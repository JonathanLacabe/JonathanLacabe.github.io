Charge causes matter to experience an electric force (see Subsection XII.III). Because the terms "negative" and "positive" are used to denote charge, summing charges is very simple when one needs to determine net charge.<br><br>

    The character '<strong>q</strong>' is used to denote the net charge on an object.

        </strong> The '<strong>Coulomb</strong>' is the SI unit for Electric Charge. Specifically, it is defined as the "amount of electric charge  transported by a current of one ampere flowing for one second" (see definitions of each new term, they are gone over in more depth later on).<br><br>

      By itself, a Coulomb is a huge amount of charge - charged particles like protons and electrons have electric charges many orders of magnitude smaller than a single Coulomb. Two objects, each with one Coulomb of charge, located one meter apart, experience an electric force (see Subsection XII.III) of roughly nine billion Newtons.

	    <strong><a href="#ExcessChargeDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ExcessChargeDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Excess Charge</font></strong>: The state of an object being more positively or negatively charged due to a lack or oversupply of negatively-charged electrons, the movement of which can be facilitated by rubbing objects together (<u>charging by friction</u>). Since positive ions are fixed in place, an object can only change in charge through the removal or addition of negative charges.<br><br>
	    
	    An "excess positive charge" is slang for an electron deficit, while an "excess negative charge" means an oversupply of electrons.<br><br>
	    
	    Note that the excess charge is effectively the total charge of the object, considering how an object without excess charge is considered to have a net-zero charge (neutral).

	    <strong>Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel</strong>.<br><br>

Example: Rubbing a balloon against one's hair will cause the electrons to move from the hair to the balloon (a transfer faciliated by rubbing), causing the balloon to stick to the hair. Furthermore, since each hair will become more positively-charged, they will repel one another, causing one's hair to stick up and separate.

        </strong> An <strong>atom</strong> is the smallest unit of matter retaining the chemical properties of its element. It is composed of a dense <strong>nucleus</strong> with Protons and Neutrons, and surrounded by orbitals of Electrons.<br><br>

        Electrons & Protons are small <u>particles</u> (e.g., specks of mass) that carry an <em>electric charge</em> with a magnitude of ~1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, which is referred to as the <strong>"Elementary Charge"</strong>. Protons are positively charged, while electrons are negatively charged.<br><br>
        
        Electrons are elementary particles, indivisible by nature, while protons and neutrons are composed of <strong>quarks</strong>, the REAL smallest particles. Specifically, the proton has two up quarks and one down quark.<br><Br>
        
        The up quark has a charge of +(2/3)e, while the down quark has the charge -(1/3)e. Thus, the net quark of a proton is +e.<br><br>
        
        The neutron, being composed of one up quark and two down quarks, has a net charge of 0. If this were not the case, the neutron would not be electrically neutral, and the nucleus of an atom would tear apart as the protons would repel from one another without the stabilizing force of the neutrons. <br><br>

        </strong> There is an equation relating net charge and elementary charge (or any quantifiable proportion of elementary charge), useful for determining how many excess charge carriers it would take for a specific net charge to be achieved:<br><br>

        <strong>q = n × e</strong><br><br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = Net charge on an object.<br>
        <strong>n</strong> = Excess number of charge carriers (protons or electrons or whatever - it just has to be ONE of them).<br>

        </strong> Charge is <strong>quantized</strong>, meaning that it must come in discrete quantities, integer multiples of the elementary charge. This is because the 'net charge' of an object is the product of having more or fewer charged particles, and thus only multiples of the elementary charge are possible (since elementary particles are indivisible).<br><br>

Using the net/elementary charge relation (see Rule 159), one can find that it is impossible for an object to have a net negative charge of 2.00 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, as such a net force would require 1.25 electrons, violating quantization.</div><br><br>

        </strong> When the atoms of a conductor form a solid, some of their outermost (and most loosely held) electrons become free to wander about within the solid, leaving behind positively charged atoms (positive ions). These wandering electrons are known as <strong>conduction electrons</strong>. There are practically no free electrons in a nonconductor, since those electrons are tightly bound to their atoms.<br><br>
        
        Knowledge of the "mobility of charge" within conductors, and conductors alone, is fundamental for comprehending concepts in Electric Field and Charge-Flux Law type questions - see Rule 169.

        </strong> <strong>Law of Electric Force (Coulomb's Law)</strong> <strong><font color="#CD7F32">(<u>8</u>)</font></strong>: VECTOR.<br><br>

<u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Newtons.<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>

<strong>F<sub>e</sub> = (k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub>) / (r²)</strong><br><br>

<strong>F<sub>e</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric force that exists between two charged particles.<br>
<strong>k</strong> = The Coulomb constant, equal to 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²). <br>
<strong>q<sub>1</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 1, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>q<sub>2</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 2, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The distance between the centers of charge of the two objects.

<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Coulomb's Law, hereafter referred to as the Law of Electric Force, enables one to find the magnitude of the Electric Force with respect to two particles.<br><br>

Note that this equation looks very similar to <!--hella like--> the Universal Law of Gravitation (see Rule 142). Accordingly, k (the Coulomb constant) functions similar to G (the Gravitational constant), being equal to (N × m²) / (a particular composition property of mass)². Clearly, since the Coulomb constant is 20 orders of magnitude stronger than the Gravitational constant, the Electric Force between objects is much more powerful than their Gravitational attraction. F<sub>e</sub> &gt;&gt;&gt; F<sub>g</sub>.<br><br>

If the calculated Electric Force has a <strong>Negative Value</strong>, then it is an <u><em>attractive force</em></u>. If the Electric Force has a <strong>Positive Value</strong>, then it is a <u><em>repulsive force</em></u>. This is quite obvious upon momentary consideration - a negative and a positive charge will always produce a negative, and thus attractive force, which matches the Law of Charges that opposite's attract. Thus also follows for repulsive like charges.

        </strong> <!--I am very happy about this Rule - what you have in textbooks and whatever is the raw information, but the 'in-the-field' knowledge that you can only obtain by doing the problems and thinking shit out rationally by yourself, 'homework rules' as I call it, that is the most important and valuable educational resource that you can have in creating your knowledge tool for relearning content after the fact. You regain that state of mind that, that creative flow specific to that topic.-->

With charges, the fundamental concept to understand in applying the Law of Electric Force <!--in any circumstance-->is that in order to derive any useful information (depending on the question, but in general), you must determine the effect of the electric force on the individual point charges. Specifically, you must be able to determine the direction the charges will move in as a result of the force.<br><br>

The Law of Electric Force determines the repulsive or attractive force acting on both charges, since they are a Newton's Law Force Pair (see Rule 76). However, in addition, you must utilize this information to determine the direction of the movement of each charge. If you have a proton on the left and an electron on the right, the proton will move rightward and the electron leftward as they attract toward one another.

<strong><font color="blue"><a href="#PermittivityFree"><span class="mw-headline" id="PermittivityFree">#</span></a> Permittivity of Free Space:</font></strong><br>
	    There is a concept known as <em>Electric Permittivity</em> that is discussed in Section XVI, Rule 211. It is an attribute that fluctuates in value from problem to problem according to its equation. It essentially measures the Polarization (Rule 168) of a specific type of material (a dielectric, see Rule 215), and will be discussed more fully at a later time.<br><br>
	    
	    What can be revealed right now, and what will become fundamental for future sections, is the "<strong>Permittivity of Free Space</strong>", a <u>constant</u> value that measures how dense an electric field (in relation to an electric charge) will be "permitted" to form within a vacuum. Thus, all equations that use the constant imply that the electric field is being formed within a vacuum.<br><br>
	    
	    The Permittivity of Free Space is referred to as "Epsilon Naught" verbally, and has the following value:<br><br>
	    
	    <strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br><br>
	    
	    This little constant will be used everywhere. It will become ubiquitous in electromagnetism.<!--, just control-f ε0 to see!--> You will forget you ever lived without it, that there ever existed a time that it was not a fundamental part of your existence, and you will feel closer to it with each passing problem.

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: The Coulomb Constant, 'k', 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²), used in such equations as the Law of Electric Force (see Rule 162) and all its applications, has a special fixed relationship with another constant. This other constant is  the <strong>permittivity constant</strong>, also just known as the <strong>permittivity of free space</strong> (described above).<br><br>

This equation, of course, can be substituted in for 'k' wherever applicable. Furthermore, ε<sub>0</sub> itself, as described in the "Permittivity of Free Space" blue section above, appears in several equations by itself, most notably the Charge-Flux Law (see Rule 187). The reasons for the usage of Coulomb's Constant at all is a matter of antiquated historical decisioning that we have to live with today.

        </strong> <strong>GROUND.</strong><br><br>

All excess charges can quickly be diffused through the usage of a <strong>Ground</strong>. A Ground is any sort of release point (if excess negative) or gain point (if excess positive) for the excess charges of a system: an ideal ground is an infinite well (see VII.VI) of charge carriers - such a requirement is effectively met by the Earth.<br><br>

An <strong>Earth Ground</strong> is created when a circuit has a physical connection to the earth, in order to sink (lose) or source (obtain) electrons through the earth itself. The Earth has a practically infinite number of electrons that can be used to balance out a circuit/system, pulling from or giving to it. Relative to very small charged systems, the human skin could serve as a ground as well.<br><br>

The end result of a ground is an electrically neutral system.<br><br>

In electrical engineering, all circuits require a Ground to function - it is often referred to as "GND", and has its own symbol for use in diagrams (see E.E. Rule [[[). In many electrical situations, without the availability of a physical connection to the Earth, a "<strong>Floating Ground</strong>" can be used, which simply serves as a type of '0V reference line' (see def. of Voltage) that acts as a return path for current back to the negative side of the power supply.</div><br><br>

        </strong> There are two distinct categories, processes under which charge is transferred. Specific means of transfer, like charging by friction (rubbing) fall under these wider processes. These processes are <strong>Conduction</strong>, and <strong>Induction</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>Conduction</strong>:<br><br>

This is the transfer of charge in which current flows because of the electric field. There are only two requisites for an object to be charged by conduction, through another object:<br><br>

1. The objects have to touch.<br><br>

2. The objects must, after touching, have the same sign of net charge.<br><br><br>

<strong>Induction</strong>:<br><br>

This is the transfer of charge in which a changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force (see Rule [[[), resulting in an <em>induced</em> charge. It is not important to fully understand what an "electromotive force" is right now, just that it is the electric force that drives current through a circuit.
<br><br>

There are only two requisites for an object to be charged by conduction, and they are the eact opposite of conduction:<br><br>

1. The objects do not touch.
<br><br>

2. The objects must finish with opposite signs of net charge.</div><br><br>

            <font color="red">P. Rule <span class="rule-number"></span>.</font>
        </strong> <strong>Polarization</strong>:<br><br>

Polarization is the process through which the charges within objects (and thus their associated particles) align themselves in such a way that there becomes a net attractive force, as a result of attraction & repulsion from an object with excess charge.<br><br>

Polarization doesn't change the net charge of the object, but rather has to do with how charges rearrange themselves within the object.<br><br>

The process itself is simple: When an object with an excess charge approaches a neutral object, the like charges will repel and the opposite charges will attract (the electrons being the sole moving particles, moving either in front of or behind the protons). Since the opposite charges will be closer to the charges of the object than the like charges, by the Law of Electric Force, there will be a net attractive electric force, since the opposite charges have a smaller 'r' value than the like charges.<br><br>

This is the reason that balloons stick to walls once they have an excess negative charge. The wall, as an insulator without free electrons, cannot "attract" the charge of the balloon. Instead, the charges in the wall rearrange themselves and end up with that net attractive force.<br><br>

Electric force due to polarization is small - objects with small masses, like balloons and aluminum cans, can be held in place and rolled respectively using only a small electric force.<br><br>

Electric force caused by the polarization of a conductor is typically larger than a polarized insulator. This is because electrons in insulators are bound in their atoms, while electrons in conductors are able to move to the opposite side of the object.<br><br>

For information as to how polarization can be used to the advantage of a capacitor (Section XVI), see Rule 215.

        </strong> <strong>Placement of Charge within Conductors & Nonconductors:</strong><br><br>

The nature & positioning of the charge within the thickness of an object (like a shell or thick cylinder) differs depending on whether the material of the object is a conductor or insulator<!--; there is no other possibility-->.<br><br><br> 

<strong>Conductive</strong> objects (enclosed shapes) spread out all excess charge (read: electrons) over their external surface. This is because the conduction electrons of the conductor (see Rule 161) and the excess charge electrons will repel from one another, causing the excess charge electrons to spread over and distribute across the farthest possible surface.<br><br>

If the object is symmetrically shaped, like a sphere, this distribution will be uniform. Otherwise, if the object is irregularly shaped, then surface charge density will vary and have specific maximums - see Rule 195 for a complete description.<br><br>

<strong>!!!NOTE!!!</strong>: Unless the conductor is spherical, the charge will <u>not distribute itself <em>uniformly</em></u>. This is a matter of symmetricality, an attribute that leads spheres (shell or solid) to naturally become uniformly distributed in charge, but not any other shape. This is not to say that a question will not simply say "assume a uniform charge density" for some ridiculous, nonspherical shape, violating the laws of physics for the sake of examining<!--torturing--> the physicist. In such a case, you would do as told and use the given information appropriately. The surface charge density σ (charge per unit area) varies over the surface of any nonspherical conductor. The electric field (see Section XIII) immediately outside of the surface of the nonspherical shape can be determined quite easily however, as described in Rule 196.<br><br>

This concentration of charge on the external surface is the same for both positive and negative excess charge. If there is an excess positive charge (imagine the conduction electrons have been removed), then the positive charge will then spread uniformly across the surface. In other words, the "absence of electrons" will be uniformly distributed.<br><br>

In the state of uniform charge distribution, the conductor will be in a state of <em>electrostatic equilibrium</em> - see Rule 193 for a complete explanation involving Electric Fields.<br><br><br>

<strong>Nonconductive</strong>/Insulating objects (enclosed shapes), which do not allow free movement of charge, bind electrons to their atoms and thus do not move to redistribute excess charge. When an excess charge is added, there are conduction electrons that would even allow for the charge to be moved, and so the excess charge will simply remain wherever it is placed.<br><br>

Thus, the excess charge <em>can</em> be uniformly distributed if that is the state in which it is added, and questions oftentime instruct the physicist<!--that's you!--> to assume such a condition. However, if the charge is concentrated in a particular region, it will not naturally redistribute itself as it would in a conductor.<br><br>

For a continuation of this Rule, with respect to how the conductor/nonconductor dispersal of charge affects electric field distribution, see Rule 193.

        </strong> <strong>Shell Theorems of Electric Force:</strong><br><br>
        <strong><em>Shells</em></strong>, spherical entities of a specified thickness and a hollow interior (like a ring rotated 180° along the x-axis), retain the same importance they had in Mechanics for Electromagnetism.<br><br>

Akin to the Shell Theorem for Internal Gravitation (see Rule 151), there are TWO Shell Theorems for Electric Fields - yet another similarity between electric force and gravitational force (see Rule 162 for the first). They are relatively straightforward, but are only applicable under the specified conditions.<br><br>

These theorems literally <u>do not work</u> for any shape other than a shell/sphere - there is a particular symmetry with those specific shapes that allow these theorems to be used. They are not true for just any irregular, wack shape.<br><br>

Fundamental to the understanding of these theorems is the nature of charge distribution on shells, which itself depends on whether the shell is conductive or not. 
See Rule 169 for a full, generalized treatment of these principles. Nonconductive shells are <em>not</em> in a state of electrostatic equilibrium (see Rule 193), unlike Conductive shells.
<br><br>

<ol>

<li> A charged particle <u><strong>outside</strong></u> of a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface (e.g., a conductor) is attracted or repelled as if the shell’s charge were concentrated as a particle at its center. This is assuming the charge on the shell is much greater than the charge of the particle, thus not interfering with the distribution of charge on the shell (an issue detailed in Rule 169).</li>

<br><br>

<li> A charged particle inside a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface (e.g., any conductor, and any nonconstructor created in such a way) will have no net force acting on it due to the shell.</li>


</ol>

These theorems can be definitively proven using the futurely-explained Charge-Flux Theorem, done in Rule 197.

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: An Electric Field is a field in space surrounding a charged object, in which the object's electric force has strength.<br><br>
      
      Electric fields have their direction expressed in the form of lines, the nature of which is elucidated in Rule 173. <u><em>Naturally</em></u> (meaning without the interference of another electric field), these lines, which originate at every point of the object's surface, will be perpendicular to the object and will point radially outward or inward (depending on the charge sign) forever without bending - the electric field of a point charge, for example, will shoot off in every direction in such a way. The direction and lines themselves, however, can be influenced as a result of the Law of Charges and can bend accordingly - see Rule 173.



<br><br>
<!--"Uniform" electric fields have all-->

Technically, the given equation dictates that the electric field is the "amount of electric force per charge at a point in space", the ratio between the electric force of the charge and the magnitude of the charge itself. All charge creates an electric field in relation to its electric force.<br><br>

The reason an exact magnitude value can be determined for an electric field (an inherently emanating and changing entity), as is done in the given equation, is because the magnitude being found is that of the strength of electric field at a particular point, denoted by the electric force experienced by the charge placed at that point.

        </strong> The magnitude of the electric field will decrease as the test charge gets farther from the point charge, as a result of the Law of Electric Force (since the denominator distance value increases and all). The electric field surrounding (and caused by) a point charge is constant at a constant radius from the point charge.<br><br>

        The entire Law of Electric Force equation can be substituted into the Electric Field equation, enabling one to simplify things considerably if the circumstances allow.

        </strong> <strong>Electric Field Lines</strong>:<br><BR>

<strong>1.</strong> The lines of attraction in an electric field always point away from the positive charge (origination) and toward the negative charge (termination). Thus, the lines always point in the direction in which the test charge would experience an electric force.<br><Br>

<strong>2.</strong> The # of electric field lines per unit area is proportional to the electric field strength. Therefore, a higher density of electric field lines means a higher electric field strength.<br><br>

<strong>3.</strong> Electric field lines always start perpendicularly to the surface of the charge, and start on a positive charge and end on a negative charge (unless there is more of one charge, in which case some lines would start/end infinitely far away).<br><br>

<strong>4.</strong> Electric field lines never cross.<br><br>

Use the test charge (a positive entity - see the <a href="#TestChargeDef">definition</a>) as the sample particle, for the sake of illustrating this point.<br><br>

When the test charge (standardized as positive) is placed in the field of a positive point charge, the test charge will be repelled from the point charge. Electric force projects radially outward from the positive point charge, decreasing in magnitude as distance increases.<br><Br>

On the flip side, if the point charge is negative, then the test charge will be attracted toward the point charge. All of the arrows will point radially inward toward the negative point charge.

        <strong>r</strong> = The distance between the infinitesimal charge dq and the point where the electric field is being calculated. Unlike the Law of Electric Force, this r is a function that varies depending on the charge, since there is technically an <em>infinite</em> number of charges (dq).<br><br>
        <strong>r&#x302;</strong> = The unit vector pointing from dq (whichever charge) toward the test charge - this is most applicable post-integral, when you can have a test charge to calculate the strength of the electric field with respect to. The direction points radially outward for positive dq, and inward for negative dq.<br><br><br><br>


        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: A <strong>Continuous Charge Distribution</strong> (CCD) is a simple concept that elaborates the simple 'point' model of charges into one that uses calculus to account for more chargetype possibilities, furthering the infinite journey into human knowledge.<br><br>

        A 'continuous charge distribution' is simply a charge that <em>isn't</em> a point charge; e.g., a charge with a shape and an electric charge continuously distributed throughout the object. <!--The shape and charge of the CCD will, of course, hugely impact the strength of the electric field at various points.--><br><br>
        
        The electric field that exists around a continuous charge distribution can be determined through a rethinking of the standard Electric Field-Law of Electric Force combined equation (see Rule 171) using Calculus. Since the charged object is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimally small point charges ('dq' representing them individually), the therefore infinite number of electric fields can be calculated using an integral.<br><br>
        
        There are very specific use cases for this integral: it is not applicable everywhere. See Rule 175 for a detailed treatise on this cases and their exceptions.
        
        The limits of integration of the integral are specific to each problem and can be determined through ingenuity and through the power of the indomitable human spirit.<br><br>
        
        That pesky 'dq' thing can be switched out by taking the derivative of any of the charge densities (see <a href="#LinearChargeDensity">linear</a>, <a href="#SurfaceChargeDensity">surface</a>, and <a href="#VolumetricChargeDensity">volumetric</a>), depending on what one is looking for.<br><br>
        
        The Electric Potential created by a CCD has a near identical equation to its electric field, described in Rule 205.

        </strong> <!--the android rule. one of my greatest masterpieces, a testament to my power of elucidation. unironically took me 4 hours of writing and revision as I was learning a concept for the first time.-->
The integral equation for CCDs (continuous charge distributions, see Rule 174) is only applicable when <u>every infinitesimal charge has its electric field pointing in the same direction when it is pointing toward the test point</u>. For example: when the CCD is a flat line, and the test charge is on its same axis.<br><br>

There are some workarounds in which the above stipulation is technically still respected, allowing the integral to still be used even for shapes like rings. This is when all components in all other directions cancel out, leaving only the components in a specific direction. For example, in a uniformly charged ring, the horizontal components of the field from symmetric charge elements cancel, leaving only the vertical (axial) component.<br><br>

When all fails, and the direction of the electric at test charge P is simply not the same for every charge dq on the ring, then take the derivative of both sides of the equation (giving d<span class="vecteur">E</span>) and try to see if any components cancel eachother out anywhere - in order to find the components, use the direction of the electric field from or toward the test charge (remember: the direction points radially outward for positive dq, and inward for negative dq), and imagine that beyond the test charge or dq, wherever the direction points, the direction line continues - this extended line segment represents d<span class="vecteur">E</span>, which can then be broken into components (which will hopefully cancel out in one direction). If there are equal negative and positive dq's in a particular direction, then it cancels out. Ideally, the direction that doesn't cancel out should only a single sign no matter the direction/origin of the dq.<br><br>

<!--halfway between android and human-->

Generally, the dq electric field values in a particular direction 'cancelling out' is the result of a symmetry created by the placement of the point charge. For example, a point charge placed somewhere along the axis of the center of the ring.<br><br>

If one has succeeded in cancelling out, then they would be able to proceed with all the necessary moving of sines or cosines (resultant from the components) and the general transfiguration of terms dependent on the characteristics of the problem itself. After one has been able to simplfy and reduce everything into only one real variable on one side (every other symbol just being a constant), then both sides can be integrated, creating a problem-specific version of the hyper-generalized CCD integral equation (see Rule 174).
<br><br>

All this component business requires that there be some reference position, a known x-axis and y-axis positioning in relation to the given CCD and point charge that can be used to derive the components from.

        </strong> Note that the farther you get from a finite continuous charge distribution, the more the electric field caused by the CCD<!--thing--> matches the electric field caused by a point charge (as in, the simplified Law of Electric Force + Electric Force equation from way back when (see Rule 172)).

        </strong> Always be aware of what constants/variables are much much greater than others. In end game integrals, such as in CCD-type problems (see Rule 175), this can totally simplify whole entire parts of your equation by just thinking of the lesser variable as zero (where it is left alone and not acting as a coefficient).

        </strong> You can never assume that the equation for the electric field of a shape, whether 2d or 3d, will be the same if the shape is a conductor or a nonconductor. The world is not such a simple, idealistic place, even in what is essentially toy model physics (classical electromagnetism).<br><br>

        The key factor in determining whether the electric field equation for a shape is the same or differing between conductors and nonconductors, is how the charge distributes within the shape.<br><br>
        
        
        The following characteristics are indicative of <strong>identical equations</strong> between the electric field equations of a conductor and nonconductor shape:<br><br>
        
        <ol>
        
          <li><strong>Infinite Reach</strong>: If the shape is infinite (like infinite planes or cylinders), then both conductors and nonconductors produce the same electric field at points sufficiently far from the charge distribution. Example: Infinite planes as explained in Rule 179.
        
          </li><br>
        
        
          <li><strong>Symmetric Charge Distributions</strong>: There are cases in which some form of symmetry causes the charge distribution to remain unchanged between the conductor and nonconductor.<br><br>
          For example: an infinite line of charge with uniform charge density λ produced the same radial field for both conductors and nonconductors, since, being a line, the charge is "on the surface" regardless of the conductivity of the shape (in terms of how the charge being on the surface is an important distinction between conductors and nonconductors and alters the calculation of their electric fields - see Rule 169), and is emanating outward in the same fashion.
          </li><br>
        
        
          <li><strong>External Field Only</strong>: If only the electric field <em>outside</em> of an enclosed shape is being considered, then IF SYMMETRY DICTATES A FIXED CHARGE DISTRIBUTION (like shells and spheres and cylinders and whatnot, not just any wack enclosed shape), then the equation for that electrical field in particular will be the same whether the shape material is a conductor or nonconductor. This is more due to the first shell theorem (see Rule 170) than anything.
          </li>
        
        </ol><br><br>
        
        
        The following characteristics are indicative of <strong>differing equations</strong> between the electric field equations of a conductor and nonconductor shape:<br><br>
        
        <ol>
        
          <li><strong>Internal Charge within Enclosed Shapes</strong>: As everyone knows, the charge within an enclosed shape for conductors and nonconductors differs as a result of charge placement in the solid part of the shape (like the shell part of a hollow shell) - see Rule 169. Conductors have zero electric field within themselves, and nonconductors do have some.
        
          </li><br>
        
          <li><strong>Non-Uniform Charge Distribution</strong>: Conductors force charge to redistribute, whereas insulators allow charge to remain fixed. For example: a finite conducting "slab" (like a brick) with excess charge will concentrate charge at the edges, while a nonconductor could have uniform volume charge density.<br><br>
        This will cause differing internal and external electric fields, both for the reason outlined in Difference Characteristic #1 (directly above) and for not meeting the symmetricality requirement of Equivalence Characteristic #3 (further above).
        
          </li>
        
        <!--
        There is an additional difference characteristic for "dielectric" effects, like dipole moments and stuff like that, but it seems like an obscure edge case that doesn't really needs its own treatise.

        <!--derived using simple magic,--> 
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: The Electric Field due to a (flat) <strong>uniformly charged disk</strong> and due to an <strong>infinite sheet</strong> are, in fact, closely related, the latter effectively being derived from the former.<br><br>
        
        The first equation gives the electric field magnitude on the central axis through a flat, circular, uniformly charged disk. The equation is derived in a highly logical and annoying manner, found <a href="https://archive.is/QHxKN">here</a> (offsite).<!--https://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/phys208/exercises/kevan/efield1.html--><br><br>
        
        If one were to plug in infinity for R, letting the radius rise to infinity while keeping the z value finite, then the equation would simplify to that of the equation for the electric field of an <strong>infinite plane</strong>, the second given equation. By their very nature, all fields produced by infinite planes will be uniform, and thus will not change with respect to distance. The straight, parallel field lines will neither converge nor diverge from their source (the plane), and as such the field intensity will never change. <STRONG>READ: Electric Field is Uniform when created by a plane.</strong><br><br>
        
        Note that despite the equation specifically being for disks and circular 2d shapes, the very act of making the radius infinite will create a plane, and thus makes its circular origins irrelevant.<br><br>
        
        By virtue of the shape being infinite (passing Equivalence Characteristic #1, see Rule 178), the infinite plane equation is true for both conductor and nonconductor infinite planes. Furthermore, know that it is also the equation for the electric field at the surface of a nonconductor, as explained in Rule 196.

        </strong> Because of the 1/z³ dependence, the field magnitude of an electric dipole decreases more rapidly with distance than the field magnitude of either of the individual charges forming the dipole (which depends on 1/r²).

        </strong> <strong>Electric Dipole Moment</strong>:<br><br>

The 'qd' from the Dipole Electric Field equation (see Rule 180) is known as the <strong>Electric Dipole Moment</strong>, and can have the value '<span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span>' substituted in for it. It has the unit of the coulomb-meter, of course.<br><br>

The Dipole Moment is defined as the magnitude of the dipole, purely a matter of charge and distance. This is separate from the magnitude of the electric field of the dipole at a point - that already has its own equation established, see Rule 180. The electric field generated by the dipole is proportional to the dipole moment, though they are <u>always</u> in opposite directions, since the electric field points from the positive charge to the negative charge.<br><br>

<!-- What is significant about it, however, detached from its dictionary definition, is how it effectively functions both centrally and independently to the electric field equation, highlighted in Rule 181.

no idea where I was going with this. too tired for this nonsense.-->

The Electric Dipole Moment is to the Dipole Electric Field equation, what the Discriminant is to the Quadratic Formula (see Math Rule 33), perhaps even to a further degree in which the electric dipole moment can be considered even more important than its forebear.<br><br>

The direction of <span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span> is simply the axis on which the dipole resides, while the <em>sense</em> (see Math Rule [[[) is pointing from the negative toward the positive charge of the dipole.

          Many molecules, such as water, have permanent electric dipole moments. In all isolated atoms and in some types of molecules, the centers of the positive and negative charges coincide and thus have no dipole. These are known as <strong>nonpolar molecules</strong>.<br><br>

However, if such an atom or a nonpolar molecule were to be placed in an external electric field, the field would distort the electron orbits and separate the centers of positive and negative charge, effectively <em>creating</em> an electric dipole.<br><br>

Because the electrons are negatively charged, they tend to be shifted in a direction opposite the field. This shift sets up a dipole moment <span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span> (see Rule 182) that points in the direction of the field. This dipole moment is said to be <em><u>induced</u></em> by the field, while the atom or molecule is then said to be <em><u>polarized</u></em> by the field (that is, it has a positive side and a negative side).<br><br>

When the field is removed, the induced dipole moment and the polarization disappear.

In defining "<strong>Electric Flux</strong>", the focus of this section, one must understand a fundamental reconsideration of how one views <em>electric fields</em> themselves - if not, the following definitions and descriptions of Electric Flux will seem nonsensical.<br><br>

First, note that the previous usage of electrical fields treated them like a structured object, a <em>vector</em> field, in which every point in space around it has a magnitude and a direction in relation to the field. In this mindset, an electric field is limited to just being a function that varies with spacial positioning.<br><br>

The new, super <!--graphic--> ultra modern rethinking of electric fields, treats them as a <u>measurement of an amount</u> - something that can be summed up, through integration. By saying "the amount of electric field", what this statement is really referring to is the cumulative <em>influence</em> of the electric field across a given area - in relation to electric flux, the cumulative influence of the electric field passing through a surface.<br><br>

This use of language is jarring at first, but can be quickly accustomed to by the young physicist. Before, electric fields were solely used in the form of a countable noun (like "apples") - now, they can also be used in the form of an uncountable noun (like "knowledge"). Without further ado:<!--<br><br><br>-->

Given how the existing Electric Field equation (see Rule 171) only specifically calculates the magnitude of an electric force at a point, this equation is overly idealized in assuming a <em>uniform</em> electric field (therefore not a point charge or anything similar). <br><br>

<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> = The magnitude of the area of the surface through which the uniform electric field is passing. AREA, not VOLUME (explained in def.).<br><br>

<strong>θ</strong> = The angle between the directions of the electric field and the direction of the area (area having its direction perpendicular to the plane, and directed outward for closed surfaces). This value, given that all other values in the equation are positive magnitudes, determines whether the flux is positive or negative.<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: <strong>Electric flux</strong> is the measure of the <em>amount of electric field</em> (see Rule 183) which passes through a defined area. The given equation is specifically for uniform electric fields, something that is totally idealized and never really happens in reality.<br><br>

This equation in particular is the result of a dot product between the electric field and the surface - this is why the result of the equation is a scalar, and why a cosine is used for the theta.<br><br>

Because this equation is a dot product, that means the two variables are vectors, both with magnitude and direction. Area, the result of a cross product between two vectors (see Math Rule [[[), has a direction normal to the plane of the area, just like how the direction of angular velocity is normal to the plane in which the object is rotating (see Rule 53).<br><br>

Note that this equation uses <strong>AREA</strong>, not VOLUME. When the electric field is passing a multi-sided object, the electric flux must be determined for each side of the object and summed thereafter, forming Φ<sub>total</sub>.<br><br>

Generally, using this equation to determine electric flux is optimal when the flux is passing through some sort of <u>closed surface</u> (see Rule 186).

        </strong> If the surface of which the electric field is passing through is perpendicular to the electric field, then since the angle created between the surface and the field will be 90° (and as cos(90) = 0), there will be a net zero electric flux acting upon that surface. This is true for both uniform (see Rule 184) and nonuniform (see Rule 187) electric fields.<br><br>
        
        NEVER, ever assume that a net zero electric flux means net zero electric <em>field</em> - it just means that all the electric field entering into the surface is passing through and out of it, which furthermore just means there is no inner charge. There can still be a net electric field at the individual points inside the surface.

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

Nonuniform Electric Fields are the standard form of Electric Fields: a field emanating outward (from a point charge or CCD), decreasing in strength with distance (symbolized in the 'r' of the Law of Electric Force (see Rule 162)).<br><br>

A new equation, an adapted form of the Uniform Electric Flux equation (see Rule 184), accounts for this previously irreconcilable difference. Again, <!--in the same vein--> as was done for Electric Fields with Continuous Charge Distribution (Rule 174), this adaptation/rethinking will be done using Calculus.<br><br>

Infinitesimally small areas of the surface plane, d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>, will replace <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>.<!--Likewise--> Correspondingly, infinitesimally small fluxes dΦ<sub>E</sub> (created by the electric field) will pass through d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>.<br><br>

Substituting these values into the original uniform equation (see Rule 184), and then integrating both sides, produces the new, revolutionary Nonuniform Electric Flux equation (though you could use it for uniform fields if you really wanted to).<br><br>

This equation is known as Gauss's Law, hereafter referred to as the <strong>Charge-Flux Law</strong>. This law, in serving nonuniform electric fields (all real ones), relates electric flux through a "Gaussian surface" to the charge enclosed by said surface.<br><br>

The shapes of these surfaces can be specifically chosen for characteristics that significantly simplify calculations in specific problems. See Rule 189 for what these characteristics entail.<br><br>

The loop on the integral sign denotes a <strong>closed surface integral</strong> (see Math Rule [[[), meaning that one must integrate over the entire closed surface to get the net flux through the surface. The only major difference from this to integrating normally is that you essentially have to sum the normal integrals of each side of the object. This must be done every time!

<!--E.g., just integrate as normal, but know that this new integral symbol has SYMBOLISM and MEANING that makes it unique and special.<br><br>--></div><br><br><br>

        </strong> If the net charge (q<sub>enclosed</sub>) inside a closed surface, Gaussian or otherwise, is zero, then the net electric flux through that surface/shape is zero. This is because all of the electric field entering into the shape exits right through the other side. There must be some charge coming from the inside of the object for there to be any electric flux.<br><br>

          Never confuse electric field for electric flux! The Charge-Flux Law can just as easily be used to isolate net electric field as it can be used to find electric flux; indeed, the net electric field of an object is as dependent on outside charges as internal ones - 'tis what the <em>net</em> electric field acting upon an object means.</div><br><br>

        </strong> A <strong>Gaussian surface</strong> is a three-dimensional closed surface in which flux of any kind is calculated.<br><br>
        
        Generally, these surfaces, when used in problems, are imaginary, though, <u>according to legend</u>, they could be real physical surfaces. Such an event, apart from the surface coinciding exactly with an actual physical surface (in which case there would be no point bothering with the Gaussian surface at all), is never used or asked for ever, and thus one should always consider Gaussian surfaces as nonexistent, imagined surfaces without the burden of its own charge conflicting with that of another (as is the case with shells that have internal point charges).<br><br>
        
      In most cases, all references to a "Gaussian Surface" can be replaced by a simple description of a closed surface - there is <u></u>nothing particularly unique or individual the distinguishes a ""Gaussian"" surface from any other imaginary closed surface. It is just a generic surface purpose-built as a template for flux calculations - the electromagnetic industry standard for surfaces that do not carry the usual electric properties of conductors or nonconductors.<br><br>
      
      Typically, the shapes of these surfaces are chosen such that the electric field generated by the enclosed charge is either perpendicular or parallel to the sides of the Gaussian surface. This greatly simplifies the surface integral because all the angles are multiples of 90 degrees and the cosine of those angles have a value of -1, 0, or 1. The spherical Gaussian surface is chosen so that it is concentric with the charge distribution, making the electric field constant for reasons outlined in Rule 191.<br><br>
      
      As long as the amount of charge enclosed in a Gaussian surface is constant, the total electric flux through the Gaussian surface does not depend on the size of the Gaussian surface. Gaussian Surfaces also follow the "outside charge = zero electric flux" rule, described in Rule 188.

        </strong> Gaussian surfaces, for all intents and purposes, are theoretical constructs and are exclusively used as such.<br><br><!--Only if a question/problem explicitly states that the surface should be treated as a physical solid (which is all of <u>never</u> since they will instead describe a solid object )<br><br>
        It may be stating the obvious, but understand that future me is the most clueless baboon-brained marsupial to have tread this godforsaken earth.-->
        
        Unlike regular solid shells/spheres/closed surfaces, Gaussian surfaces do not interact with nor influence internal or external charges whatsoever and cannot contribute <strong><em><u>ANY</u></em></strong> charge - they only contain/reflect charge from internal/outside sources. Charge upon the surface of a Gaussian sphere from any such outer source is unimpeded, it is just Gaussian Surfaces themselves produce none of it. Conductive and nonconductive solid spheres, which do contain charge which produce electric fields, have their own developed systems<!-- specific parameters--> for dealing with these intervening forces in calculations (see Rule 193).<br><br>
        
        This is the result of Gaussian Surfaces purely being constructs solely intended for the calculation of the <em>magnitude</em> of the electric field or flux produced by any charged object. As such, a "Gaussian Shell" is never used, since shells only have purpose in electric field calculations when there is an internal charge to the shell that can affect the net electric field/flux at a point, which is null and irrelevant with regard to Gaussian Surfaces, which can have all spherical distances/calculations accounted for solely using Gaussian Spheres.<br><br>
        
        In effect, Gaussian Surfaces are mere mathematical, superimposed bodies exploiting symmetry, with no effect of their own on anything: bodies in space whose only purpose is the use of their positioning, whether through symmetry or whatever (see Rule 189), to calculate flux or field at a particular distance from a charge in space, free from the interference of some internal charge. </div><br><br>

        Thus, for all concentric entities surrounding a point charge, where each point on the circle or sphere are at a constant distance from the point charge, the strength of the point charge at each point along the entity will be constant.<br><br>

        </strong> The individual locations of the charges within an enclosed surface are irrelevant to calculating electric flux or any variable (like Electric Field) using the Charge-Flux Law. All that is needed is the net electric charge within the surface/object - positioning is meaningless, the charges could be in each corner of a cube and it wouldn't matter.<br><br>

The net Electric Field, however, does require knowledge of the position of the charges, whether they are inside or outside of the enclosed object (due to the nature of the net electric field reflecting the collective influence of all electric fields surrounding the object, which is to say, every charge).<br><br>

This, of course, is given that you are calculating for electric field in particular, and not for electric flux itself, in which case outside charges contribute zero net flux to an object and thus do not need to be accounted for (see Rule 188).</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electric Fields, as influenced by the Placement of Charge within Conductors & Nonconductors:</strong><br><br>
        
        The placement of charge on the surface and in the thickness of an object as a result of its material (conductor or nonconductor, as previously described in Rule 169) is of considerable effect on the electric field produced by the object.<br><br>

Note that for the purposes of this section, an "<em>internal electric field</em>" is the electric field contained within the hollow part of an object, whether that object be a perfectly spherical shell or a hollow nonspherical whatever.<br><br><br>

<strong>Conductors</strong>: Since the charge of a conductor is dispersed solely along the surface of the object (see Rule 169), the internal electric field of a charged, isolated conductor is zero, and the external field (at points nearby to the surface) is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude that depends on the surface charge density <strong>σ</strong>.<br><br>

Within the thickness of a conducting <em>shell</em>, the electric field will also be zero, since the charge will remain concentrated on the surface of the object and thus will not produce <em>anything</em> internally, regardless of whether "internal" means the hollow part of the shell or the material itself. This remains the same for Irregularly shaped conductors, which are detailed in Rule 195.<br><br>

Furthermore, note that anything inside of a conductor (in electrostatic equilibrium - see the above definition) will be subject to <strong>Electrostatic Shielding</strong>: The shielding from all external electric fields. Not even external electric fields will force the inside of a conductor to have a field of its own.
<br><br>

Though nonspherical conductors do not have uniform charge density, even at their surface (as described in Rule 169), a general equation for the electric field immediately outside of the surface of the nonspherical shape can be determined quite easily, elaborated upon and derived in Rule 196.<br><Br><br>



<strong>Nonconductors</strong>, which have their charge distributed in their thickness wherever it is placed (generally expressed in problems as following a particular formula involving radius, or as simply a matter of uniform volumetric charge density), will <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> have an internal electric field within the hollow portion of the object, regardless of the placement of the charge (whether the charge is concentrated along the surface or uniformly distributed within the thickness).<br><br>


The reason for this can be visualized simply: if you were to imagine a Gaussian Surface around the hollow part of a shell/object with uniform charge density, you will find that with there being zero electric charge on the inside of the surface, there can be zero electric flux (see Rule 188). However, as noted in Rule 185, zero electric flux does NOT mean zero electric field, just that all electric field going in is leaving. Still - the effect of the electric fields produced by each charge around the hollow portion of the object will be a net zero electric field, a result of the repulsion between charge (because electric fields cannot cross - see #4 of Rule 173) effectively <!--(and simultaneously) cancelling out and--> preventing the existence of electric field within the hollow center.<br><br>

Thus, there would both be a net zero electric flux, and net zero electric field within a nonconductor.

<br><br>

Of course, this also means that if the charge distribution of the object's material is "<strong>asymmetric</strong>" (defying any logical pattern of symmetry involving radius, see Rule 194), there could theoretically be a nonzero electric field within the hollow portion of a nonconducting shell, since the electric fields produced by the charge would not cancel out nor totally repel eachother.<br><br>

For the reasons detailed in Rule 194, it is exceedingly unlikely to appear in a problem - note that it is <em>possible</em> under the laws of physics, however.<!--For the purposes of an idealized, freshman Physics curriculum--><br><br>
<!--
Only while a conductor is <em>being</em> charged, while it is <em>in the process</em> of being charged (which rarely apppears in problems), does there appear an internal electric field. Of course, the added charge will distribute itself along the surface extremely quickly.
-->


Within the shell’s thickness (between the hollow interior and the surface), the field is nonzero and varies based on the charge distribution. Outside the shell, a uniformly charged nonconducting shell behaves similarly to a conductive shell, producing an external field equivalent to that of a point charge located at the shell’s center (Shell Theorem #1 - see Rule 170).</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Asymmetric Charge Distributions:</strong><br><br>

        An asymmetric charge distribution is an uneven distribution of electric charge within a system, which results in an uneven distribution of electrical field.<br><br>
        
        The effect of an asymmetric charge distribution is profound in objects with hollow interiors, spherical or nonspherical.<br><br>
        
        An asymmetric charge distribution cannot be produced by an equation involving radius, since even an object whose charge density changes with respect to radius is still considered a symmetric distribution (regardless of whether the object is a perfect sphere or not). <br><br>
        
        Instead, it can only be expressed formulaically by creating a relation between the density and a particular point or position rather than radius, with density depending on distance from said point (such as from one end of the object). This, however, is itself a small fringe case of possible asymmetric distributions:<br><br>
        
        <!--At a certain point, a paragraph will become so bloated with parentheticals it becomes preferable to just cut the thing up. When even that doesn't resolve it, make another rule. That is basically what happened here.-->
        
        Asymmetric distributions which can be described by equation, only reflect an tiny, idealized fraction of all possible asymmetric distributions - imagine a simply random pattern of charge placements and concentrations, for example.<br><br>
        
        <!-- prev. sentence: These distributions will have a nonzero internal electric field, and there is nothing that can be done about it. -->
        
        These forms of charge distributions, when applied to a nonconducting object with a hollow center, result in a nonzero internal electric field, a special case of the nature of nonconductors as described in Rule 193, and an absolute pain to deal with. The problem must really hate you if it is going through the trouble of creating a position-based charge distribution equation just to have an internal electric field.

        Imagine two objects, one a conductor and the other a nonconductor. By the laws explained in Rule 169 (and noted again in Rule 193), the conductor, if nonspherical, will not have uniform charge density at its surface, though its charge will still be <em>concentrated</em> at its surface under the laws outlined in Rule 169.<br><br>
        
        Through the creation of an extremely small cylinder perpendicularly bisecting the surface of either object at a particular point (the size of bisection being small enough that, there, the object's surface can be considered flat, and the electric field thus perfectly perpendicular), one can discover that the only electric flux being produced is upon the cap of the cylinder, since the curved sides of the cylinder will be perpendicular to the object (nullifying the cosine of the Charge-Flux equation - see Rule 193).<br><br>
        
        Thus, in using the uniform Charge-Flux Theorem (uniform because the cylinder is small enough and directly upon the surface that the electric field can be considered perfectly perpendicular and constant at exactly that point/scale), all one needs to do is find the electric flux occurring on the cap of the cylinder, which will lead directly to an equation for the electric field.<br><br>
        
        The flux of the cap of the cylinder, being such a small distance away from the surface itself, can be taken to be the flux of that cap-shaped portion of the surface of the object itself. From there, the derivation of the equations (for a conducting object and a nonconducting object) simply follows these logical movements:<br><br>
        
        The charge q<sub>enc</sub> enclosed by the Gaussian surface lies on the object’s surface in an area A. If σ is the charge per unit area, then q<sub>enc</sub> is equal to σA. In the uniform Charge-Flux Law, substituting EA in for flux (since the cosine is nullified by the perpendicular electric field - see Rule 185), and σA in for q<sub>enc</sub>, will produce the above equations (after simplification).

        <strong><font color="blue"><a href="#ElectricInfiniteLine"><span class="mw-headline" id="ElectricInfiniteLine">#</span></a> Electric Field Near an Infinite Charged Line:</font></strong><br><br>

          The electric field at a point near (read: not infinitely away from) an infinite line of charge (or cylindrical charged rod) with uniform linear charge density 𝜆 is <u>perpendicular</u> to the line, and is defined by the following equation:
          
          $$E_{rod} = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi \varepsilon_0 r}$$
          
          <strong>E</strong> = The magnitude of the electric field near (at a distance r from) a charged rod.<br>
          <strong>λ</strong> = Linear Charge Density. See treatise <a href="#LinearChargeDensity">here</a>.<br>
          <strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).
          <br>
          <strong>r</strong> = The perpendicular distance from the line to the point.<br><br>
          
          
          The derivation is fairly simple, using a cylinder to find the electric field of the radial point in space (the infinite line running along the central axis of the cylinder), from there using the Charge-Flux Law as one normally would, nullifying the caps of the cylinder as being perpendicular to the electric field produced by the line (and thus giving no flux - see Rule 185) and only using the area of the curved side (2πrh) in the calculations. The enclosed charge being substituted for λh (since the linear charge density is uniform), this all simplifies down to the equation given.<br><Br>
          
          This equation also approximates the field of a <em>finite</em> line of charge at points that are not too near the ends, in relation to the distance r from the line.<br><br>
          
          If the rod has a uniform volume charge density ρ, a similar procedure can be used to find the magnitude of the electric field <strong>inside</strong> the rod (given the rod is not purely a flat axial line). All that would need to be done is to shrink the  cylinder until it itself is inside the rod: as a result, the charge q<sub>enc</sub> enclosed by the cylinder would  be proportional to the volume of the rod enclosed by the cylinder, since the charge density is uniform. From there, apply the Charge-Flux Law as before, the caps of the cylinder again getting nullified, r still being the radius of the cylinder itself (effectively the distance between the center of the rod to the edge of the cylinder).

        </strong> <strong>Electric Field outside and inside a Sphere</strong>:<br><br>

        The electric field due to a shell within and outside of a sphere with uniform charge density (any nonconductor, or a conductor specified as such - see Rule 169) can be determined using the Charge-Flux Law. In the process, the two Shell Theorems (see Rule 170) can be mathematically proven, whereas before they were simply stated without proof.<br><br>
        
        For the following equations, assume the variables are those depicted in the image below: 'b' for the full radius of the shell, center to exterior, and 'a' for the internal radius of the shell, center to interior.
        
        <br><br>
        <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/Physics/img/exshell.gif"><img src="/Physics/img/exshell.gif" alt="An example uniformly charged spherical shell, with a full radius of b and an internal radius of a." width=23%/></a></div>
        	    <span class="tiny"><em>An example uniformly charged spherical shell, with a full radius of b and an internal radius of a.</em></span><br><br>
        
        
        Outside a spherical shell a uniform charge density q, the electric field due to the shell is radial (the lines themselves point inward or outward, depending on the sign of the charge, while the <em>strength</em> of the lines is constant along a ring/radius, as a result of the shell have u.c.d.). For all electric fields of a radius r ≥ b, the electric field of that radius can be determined simply using the Charge-Flux Law, and has the following magnitude:<br><br>
        
        $$E_{outside} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}$$
        
        <strong>E<sub>outside</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the outward electric field created by a shell with uniform charge density.<br>
        <strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br>
        <strong>q</strong> = The total enclosed charge, namely that within the shell's material.<br>
        <strong>r</strong> = The distance to the point of measurement from the center of the shell, retricted to where r ≥ b.<br><br><br>
        
        Through a small amount of effort, one can find that this field is the very same as the field created by a shell with all of its charge concentrated in a particle of charge q in the center. Thus, the <strong>first theorem is proved</strong>.
        <br><br>
        
        
        Through an extraordinarily simple process, one can furthermore find through the Charge-Flux Law how the electric field at radius a is equal to 0, since the Gaussian surface encloses no charge. Thus, if a charged particle were enclosed by the shell, the shell would exert no net electric force on the particle. This <strong>proves the second shell theorem</strong>.<br><br><br><br>
        
        <!--[[[[future: add full derivation images in sidelinks-->
        
        <!--b = r, a = R-->
        
        Inside a sphere with a uniform volume charge density, the electric field is radial, and any radius <em>r</em> (where a ≤ r ≤ b) will have an electric field of the following magnitude:<br><br>
        
        $$E_{within} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{b^3} r$$
        
        <strong>E<sub>within</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric field within the material of a shell, between a and b.<br>
        
        <strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = The total charge WITHIN the specified radius; the charge between the inner surface of the shell and the specified radius r. All charge within the shell but outside of the radius r is irrelevant and not included in this <em>subsphere</em>.<br>
        
        <strong>b</strong> = The full radius of the shell, from center to external surface.<br>
        
        <strong>r</strong> = The radius from the center of the sphere to the point of measurement between a and b. This is akin to creating a smaller shell (cutting out the material between r and b) and measuring the electric field at its surface.</div><br><br>

          Electric potential energy works much the same as gravitational potential energy. As an object has greater gravitational potential energy the farther away it is from the source of its atraction, two oppositely charged objects, attracted to one another, will have greater <em>electric</em> potential energy the farther they are from one another. Their attraction inherently transforms this potential energy into kinetic energy as they attract, a result of the Conservation of Mechanical Energy.<br><br>

            Obversely, two charged objects that repel will have their greatest potential energy when they are closest, increasing in kinetic energy as they farthern from one another.<br><br>
            
            This is the essence of electric potential energy: the potential for two charged objects to attract or repel from one another, to <em>move</em> as a result of the electric force produced by their interacting electric fields.<br><br>

        Finding an equation to express electric potential energy is no difficult task at all. As a conservative force, the electric force can have all of the existing equations for potential energy and work (see Rule 100) applied:<br><br>

        <strong>F<sub>E</sub> = -(dU<sub>e</sub> / dr)</strong><br><br>
        
        E.g., the electric force equals the negative of the derivative of the "electric potential energy" with respect to position (the infinitesimally small change in position dr).<br><br>
        
        By simplifying this equation slightly, as in moving variables around, integrating both sides, and substituting in values for electric force, a new and improved Change in Electric Potential equation can be developed, seen above.<br><br>    
        
        The potential energy of a positive charge increases as it moves opposite the direction of the electric field, while the potential energy of the negative charge will decrease as it moves opposite the direction of the field. E.g., change in potential energy will be positive for a positive charge, and negative for a negative charge.</div><br><br><br>

<strong>V</strong> = Electric Potential, the measure of electric potential energy experienced per unit charge in an electric field. Measured in Volts.<br>

<strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the charge/charged particle of the particular point being measured.

<br><br><br>


<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

The Electric Potential is a measure of the electric potential energy experienced per unit charge in an electric field. V and ΔU are indeed different - they have the same relationship as electric field and electric force. The electric potential energy is what <em>creates</em> the electric potential. <!--I could probably write something more substantive here, but it will do for now.--><br><br>

Since Electric Potential is a scalar value, the net electric potential at a particular point is found by summing each electric potential values (from each electric field) at that point.<br><br>

In the same manner in which an electric field is defined by the force experienced by a small, positive test charge (see Subsection XIII.I), the electric potential is defined by the <em>energy</em> experienced by a small, positive test charge.<br><br>

Of considerable importance and inherent relation to electric potential is <em>Electric Potential Difference</em>, aka, voltage. For more information, see Rule 200.</div><br><br><br>

        The <em>change</em> in electric potential, derived from the Electric Potential described in Rule 199, is arguably more important and used than electric potential by itself.<br><br>
        
        Represented by <strong>∆V</strong>, the Electric Potential Difference (also known as <strong>Voltage</strong>) is the difference in the electric potential between two points: <strong>∆V = V<sub>f</sub> - V<sub>i</sub></strong>. Electic Potential Difference can be seen as an <em>electric cliff</em>, the electric parallel to gravitational potential energy.<br><br>
        
        Equations representing ∆V, slightly reworked from those of Rule 199 & Rule 198, are given above. If V<sub>i</sub> = 0, then these equations are merely calculating the electric potential at point f. When the electric field is uniform, then it can be taken out of the integral, and the equation can resolve to the following:<br><br>
        
        <strong>∆V<sub>uniform</sub> = -Ed</strong>.<br><br>
        
        Inherently, a charge does not need to move from one point to another in order for the difference to exist; ∆V's existence is only dependent on the electric field itself.

        </strong> <strong>Equipotential Surfaces/Lines</strong>:<br><br>

        An equipotential surface or line is one in which the electric potential is the same at every point along it. These lines form from (and have their shapes determined by) an electric field. Of course, this means that if the electric field is resulting from a negative charge, then each electric potential value along the equipotential line will be negative. If resulting from a positive charge, then each value will be positive. Simple as.<br><br>
        
        Equipotential Lines, also known as <strong>isolines</strong>, are always perpendicular to the electric field - thus, the electric field will have no components along the equipotential line.<br><br>
        
        In a uniform electric field, an equipotential line will be an infinite straight line. In an electric field around a charged particle, the equipotential lines will be circles concentric to the particle.<br><br>
        
        The electric potential difference between any point on one equipotential line to any point along another equipotential line will be the same.<br><br>
        
        When moving a charge along an equipotential line, the work required to do so is zero (since the electric potential difference will be zero - see Rule 207).</div><br><br>

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

      In circumstances in which you are calculating the Electric Potential generated by a single point charge (which, since Electric Potential is a scalar, just means ignoring the electric fields of any other variables in the equation (if any)), there is a single equation that you can use that works regardless of whether the charge is negative or positive (though you will have to factor this into the sign of q):<br><br>
      
      Of course, the equation above for the electric potential of the particle is effectively assigning zero electric potential to any points infinitely far away. Occasionally, a problem will state that a particle moves from "a great distance" toward its final position. This is the problem's way of telling you that the initial electric potential and electric potential energy (by Rule 199) of the particle is zero.<br><br>
      
      Note that the first equation of Rule 200 can be substituted into this equation to create an alternate definition for change in potential energy.</div><br><br><br>

        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Akin to calculating the center of mass of a system, finding the net electric potential of a system of particles is lightwork. It basically just involves summing the q/r values of each individual particle, and feeding that back into the equation from Rule 202.<br><br>
        
        The potential resulting from each charge is effectively calculated individually, summed thereafter. This sum is an <strong>algebraic sum</strong> (or <strong>scalar sum</strong>), not a <em>vector sum</em> like the sum used to calculate the electric field resulting from a group of charged particles.<br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electric Potential of a Continuous Charge Distribution</strong>: SCALAR.<br><br>
        
        <u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Volts, e.g. Joules / Coulombs. The symbol for the volts unit, hilariously, is the same as the symbol for electric potential: <em><strong>V</strong></em>.<br><br><br>

$$V_{CCD} = k \int \frac{dq}{r}$$
          
        <br>
        
	<strong>V<sub>CCD</sub></strong> = The electric potential that exists around a continuous charge distribution, calculated at point r in space.<br><br>

        <strong>dq</strong> = The infinitesimally small point charges, of which there is an infinite number of. This value can be substituted for any of the equivalent charge density derivatives (see <a href="#LinearChargeDensity">Linear</a>, <a href="#SurfaceChargeDensity">Surface</a>, and <a href="#VolumetricChargeDensity">Volumetric</a>), pursuant to the nature of a particular problem.<br><br>
        
      	<strong>r</strong> = The distance between the infinitesimal charge dq and the point where the electric field is being calculated. Unlike the Law of Electric Force, this r is a function that varies depending on the charge, since there is technically an <em>infinite</em> number of charges (dq).<br><br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: This equation is applicable for all objects with continuous charge distributions: spheres, rods, planes, what have you. Everything that isn't just a particle (or dipole), essentially.<br><br>
      
      The equation for the electrical potential of a CCD is remarkably similar to that of the electric field created by a CCD (see Rule 174) - minus the vector and the square on the distance.<br><br>
      
      Furthermore, the actual application of the equation is similar to that of electric field: That pesky 'dq' value within the integral can be substituted out by taking the derivative of any of the charge densities (see linear, surface, and volumetric), depending on what one is looking for. Additionally, in some circumstances 'r' itself has to be substituted in for another value as well, such as when a Pythagorean-theorem-style-event occurs relating to the variables given in the problem.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Kinetic Energy through Charge Movement</strong>:<br><br>

          There are two equations that can be used to find the kinetic energy of a charged object with an electric potential difference, one for if only conservative forces are acting on it, and one for if nonconservative ones are as well.<br><br>
          
          If the charged object moves through an electric potential difference ∆V without an applied force acting on it (moving purely through electric attraction), then only conservative forces are acting upon it. Applying and simplifying the conservation of mechanical energy equation gives the following equation for change in kinetic energy:<br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K = -q × ∆V</strong><br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K</strong> = Change in Electric Kinetic Energy.<br><br>
          <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the object, which is irrelevant to the positioning/movement of the object.<br><br>
          <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br><br><br><br>
          
          
          
          If, instead, an external/applied force is acting on the charged object, creating nonconservative work, then the change in kinetic energy is as follows:<br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K = (-q × ∆V) + W<sub>nonc</sub></strong><br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K</strong> = Change in Electric Kinetic Energy.<br><br>
          
          <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the object, which is irrelevant to the positioning/movement of the object.<br><br>
          
          <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br>
          
          <strong>W<sub>nonc</sub></strong> = The work produced by the external, nonconservative force, breaking the conservation of mechanical energy.<br><br><br>
          
          
          A special case can emerge in which ∆K equals to zero. Then, and only then, can W<sub>nonc</sub> be isolated in a very simple manner, just moving variables to the other side. For more details, see Rule 207 & Rule 208.</div><br><br><br>

        <strong>W<sub>particle</sub></strong> = The work performed upon the particle that causes to move, whether by an external, nonconservative force, or simply the force of an electric field. The work is equivalent to the electric potential energy.<br><br>
        
        <strong>U</strong> = The electric potential energy of the particle, equivalent to the work.<br><br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the particle, which is irrelevant to its positioning/movement.<br><br>
        
        <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br><br>
        
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: If a charged particle is moved from an initial point to a final point (differing points, obviously) via some force, then the force is performing work on the particle. Furthermore, this work will change the electric potential energy of the charge, making them equal (under the law established in Rule 100 relating work and potential energy).<br><br>
        
        The force that is causing the particle to move can either be an external, nonconservative force, or simply the force of an electric field. Either way, there is no net kinetic energy (prior to movement in the case of the electric field), and the same equation is used.<br><br>
        
        There is an equation that can be used to find this work value in relation to electric potential difference - however, it requires that there be no change in the kinetic energy of the charge. Thus, using this equation mandates either the breaking of the conservation of Mechanical Energy, or the determination of potential energy/work prior to any movement (prior to any conversion into kinetic energy).<br><br>
        
        Note that the given equation is the negative of the work produced by an electric field, which itself can be derived by applying Rule 100 equations for potential energy to the 1st equation found in Rule 200.<!--goated coincidence-->

        <strong>q<sub>1</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge of the first particle.<br><br>

	<strong>q<sub>2</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge of the second particle.<br><br>
        
        <strong>r</strong> = The distance between the two particles being considered (see definition).<br><br><br>
        
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: <strong>The total potential energy of a system of particles is the sum of the potential energies for every pair of particles in the system.</strong> The given equation is for that of a two particle system - for systems involving more particles, simply sum the collective potential energies to get a "net" work or "net" electric potential energy, in the following fashion:<br><br>

<strong>∆W = ∆U = (k / r) (q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub>) (q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>3</sub>) (q<sub>2</sub> × q<sub>3</sub>)</strong><br><br>

The above example is for only three particles. Add more pairs as needed for bigger systems.<br><br>

This equation works effectively like a combining of the equations from Rule 207 and Rule 202 - this is why the individual electric potential energies of each pair need to be summed to produce a net electric potential energy.<br><br>

The MIDI itself makes it an absolute, falsifiable, unchanging and static and logical and without room for interpretation, like a proof. The best composer to represent academia would obviously be Brahms, and despite the "Academic Festival Overture" seeming like the obvious pick, I would choose the main theme of the 4th movement of the 1st symphony to perfectly convey the feeling of academicism, of knowledge itself. One of the most important skills one can have is the ability to continue working after one gets bored, to have that self-control over one's mind - Brahms perfectly synthesizes that sort of rigid conformity to tradition (learning ancient, classical Physics) with thematic exploration (sounding good, e.g. the "fun" of Physics) so that the whole routine doesn't go stale, which is exactly what the young physicist needs to avoid crashing out upon having to memorize the inherant interrelations and (extremely idealized) equations for electric potential & electric potential energy (separate things) & work & kinetic energy & electric field & charge &-->

As known from Rule 100, Work is equal to Potential Energy when Kinetic Energy is equal to zero. Thus, using this equation mandates either the breaking of the conservation of Mechanical Energy, or the determination of potential energy/work prior to any movement (prior to any conversion into kinetic energy). As there are two particles that will naturally be drawn towards or away from eachother (depending on whether their signs match) by the electric force, there does not necessarily have to be an external force acting, and should never be assumed in a question if not explicitly stated. Either way, there is no net kinetic energy (prior to movement in the case of the electric field), and the same equation(s) can be used.

"<strong>Capacitance</strong>", indeed, is the property that enables a capacitor to do so, see Rule 212. A capacitor's capacitance relies solely on the capacitor's physical characteristics, its shape and the material (if any) used to separate the plates.<br><br>
        
        When some idiot question asks for the magnitude of the "energy" stored in the electric field of a capacitor (elitist phrasing intentionally confusing the poor physicist so that universities get more money by you failing and having to retake a class), do not let them fool you: it is only asking for the electric potential energy, which has its own equation described in Rule 218.

        </strong> <strong>Parallel Plates:</strong><br><br>
        
        If not otherwise stated, all Parallel Plates have <strong>charges of equal magnitude</strong> and <strong>opposite signs</strong>.<br><br>

        The Parallel Plate is the most basic example of a capacitor - two conductors a distance away from eachother, creating a <strong>UNIFORM</strong> electric field pointing towards the negative plate. Anywhere in the field, there will electric potential energy stored (zero at the negative plate, and maximum at the positive plate). See Rule 213 for more information.<br><br>
        
        The electric field between the two plates is always constant due to them being planes that, when considering the perspective of the infinitesimally small electron, can mathematically be considered to be infinite planes, despite having a measurable area.<br><br>
        
        Thus, the infinite plane equation of Rule 179 can be used, and since the electric fields of the positive and negative plates add together, the electric field of all parallel plates (between the plates, that is - outside of them there is no field) will always end up equalling <strong>σ / ε</strong>, with ε only being ε<sub>0</sub> when there is no dielectric (see end of Rule 216).</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electric Permittivity</strong>:<br><br>
        
        <strong>Electric Permittivity</strong>, previously famous solely for its association with the great Permittivity of Free Space constant, is a measurement of how much a material is able to be polarized (see Rule 168) when it is placed in an electric field. This is the more appropriate definition for the form of electric permittivity used in relation to capacitance, and specifically the dielectric constant - see Rule 216.<br><br>
        
        In all circumstances in which an equation uses the permittivity of free space constant, if the object/electric field has a different electric permittivity, then that new permittivity will replace ε<sub>0</sub>. For Capacitance, capacitors that don't have dielectric materials (see Rule 215) use ε<sub>0</sub> as their permittivity, while dielectric capacitors have their own special permittivity that is inherently related to the free space constant - see the blue section prior to Rule 164.<br><br>
        
        In all cases, do not be afraid of removing a permittivity constant to replace it with another constant when the situation calls for it. The Permittivity of Free Space is no longer that all-powerful ubiquitous entity that it once was.

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Capacitance is the measure of how much charge must be given to a <em>capacitor</em> (an object that stores electric potential energy - see definition) to produce a certain potential difference. It is a ratio between these two values.<br><br>
      
      Capacitance is always a positive value, and thus so are charge and voltage. None of that "two negatives cancelling out" nonsense either, only the magnitude of the charge is being considered, so it literally has to be a positive number (and thus voltage as well).<br><br>
      
      The above equation functions for ALL forms of capacitance, for any object that is capable of storing and maintaining an electric potential difference. However, the individual <em>types</em> of capacitors possess their own type-specific equations that are useful in their specific circumstances. For example, see Rule 213 for the equation of Parallel Plates, the simplest and most common type of capacitor.<!--and that which is used in circuitry diagrams.-->

	<strong>ε</strong> = Permittivity (see Rule 211) of the capacitor. If there is no Dielectric (see Rule 215), then it is the Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br>

      <strong>A</strong> = The total surface area of either plate (imagined to be infinitely thin).<br>
      
      <strong>d</strong> = The distance between the two plates. This is also the distance upon which the electric potential difference of the general equation is taken.
      
      <br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Parallel Plate Capacitors (P.P.C.'s) are the most common form of capacitor in Physics, and are amongst spherical and cylindrical capacitors as the only capacitor forms worth knowing in baby freshman Physics (alongside some additional features and tricks - see dielectrics in Rule 215 & Rule 216).<br><br>

The capacitance of a parallel plate measures how much charge must be given to the plates to produce a certain potential difference between them. The given equation was found by substituting in an equation specific to the characteristics of the parallel plates (the electric field at the surface of a conductor - Rule 196) into the uniform voltage equation of Rule 200, and then substituting in that entire mess into the generalized capacitance equation of Rule 212.<br><br>
      
      A parallel plate capacitor functions by separating the charge onto the two plates, the very act of which is performing work to keep them in place (since the plates are attracted toward eachother) and putting electric potential energy into the system.<br><br>
      
      The <em>net</em> charge on a capacitor, being composed of a negative and positive plate of equal charge magnitudes, will be zero. However, not to worry: all that is necessary for any capacitance-related calculations is the q of a single plate.<br><br>
      
      <strong>The Electric Field between the plates is always uniform</strong>, as described in Rule 210. It is always equal to <strong>σ / ε</strong>, also derived in Rule 210.<br><br>

Note that through usage of the permittivity of free space constant,  all parallel plate capacitors will be considered as being within a vacuum (for reasons explained in Rule 164). However, if a dielectric material (see Rule 215) is added between the plates, then the vacuum is rendered null and a different permittivity is used.

        </strong> A <strong>Charged Capacitor</strong> is one in which charge flow is enabled (and thus has an extant electric potential difference), allowing for all properties of capacitance to be applied. This is the state that <u>every</u> problem relating to capacitance will place the capacitor in, and it should always be assumed for a given capacitor.<br><br>
      
      An <strong>Uncharged Capacitor</strong> (also known by idiots as a "<strong>Discharged Capacitor</strong>") has <strong><em>no</em></strong> charge whatsoever. For parallel plates, this means that neither plate will have charge. Thus, there will be no electric potential/potential energy nor any electric field between the plates. In such a capacitor, the electric potential difference between the plates is zero.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Full Dielectric Analysis (for Parallel Plates).</strong><br><br>
        <!--we're getting to bottom of this dielectric business, and won't stop until the bottom of the ocean is drained and all time has ceased-->
        
        A dielectric is an insulating material placed between the plates of a capacitor, helping to physically separate the two plates and increase the capacitance through a process known as <strong>polarization</strong> (the very same that was described in Rule 168, that makes balloons stick on walls).<br><br>
        
        When a dielectric is placed within the (uniform) electric field between the plates, the electric field arranges the molecules in the dielectric according to the law of charges. <br><br>
        
        The positive sides of the molecules in the dielectric material are attracted to the negative plate of the capacitor, while the negative sides of the molecules are attracted to the positive plate.<br><br>
        
        As a result, the dielectric becomes <u>polarized</u>, with the arranged molecules forming what is known as an <strong>induced field</strong> opposite the direction of the original electric field. This new, induced field is inherently nonuniform, and while it does not outright replace the original field, it changes the scheme of what the net electric field within the parallel plates IS, and thus changes any and all calculations involving such.<br><br>
        
        <!--No idea what I was talking about here, I was in a latenitePhysics-induced delirium: The net electric field will of course now be nonuniform as well, since it incorporates the changes made to the original electric field by the nonuniform induced field.-->As a result of the induced field being opposite in direction of the original, the net electric field of a capacitor with a dielectric is <em>smaller</em> than the original electric field:<br><br>
        
        <strong>E<sub>net</sub> = E<sub>original</sub> - E<sub>induced</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        Thus, a smaller electric field will lead to a lower electric potential difference (because of the uniform equation of Rule 200). This net electric field will still retain the <strong>σ / ε</strong> equation, despite the influence of the nonuniform induced electric field.<br><br>
        
        If the capacitor is not part of a circuit (see Rule [[[), then the dielectric will <u>not</u> change the charge on the capacitor. Thus, <strong>capacitance will actually increase</strong> when there is a dielectric in place, since the electric potential difference is in the denominator of the capacitance equation (see Rule 212).<br><br>
        
        If the capacitor IS part of a circuit however, then its a totally different story.<br><br> 
        <!--[[[fix this nonsense when the time comes will a little expalantion bleeding into a "for more information" reference.-->
        
        Mathematically, the effect of the dielectric is represented using its own constant (which can be then used to create a new version of the capacitance equation), described in detail in Rule 216.</div><br><br><br>

      <br><br><br><!--THE BABY PANDA IS A 10/10/10/10/10/10 SONG-->
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: The Dielectric Constant, also known as the <strong>Relative Permittivity</strong> of a dielectric, isn't really a constant in the traditional <em>constant</em> sense, in that it fluctuates from dielectric to dielectric. While it is inherent to all capacitors that have an internal, insulating dielectric material, it depends on the characteristics and electric permittivity of that dielectric.<br><br>
      
      Do not confuse relative permittivity as the actual permittivity of a capacitor with a dielectric - relative permittivity is simply the constant that, when multiplied by the permittivity of free space, gives the special dielectric permittivity value ε<sub>dielectric</sub>.<br><br>

      The dielectric constant represents the effect and power of the dielectric on the capacitor, and is used in several equations, most notably the Dielectric Capacitance equation (see Rule 217). The easier it is for electrons to change configuration in a material (e.g., for them to move into polarized positions within a dielectric, represented by the dielectric's permittivity), the larger the dielectric constant.<br><br>
      
      The equation given for the electric fields is contingent on there being different electric permittivity values for the non-dielectric and dielectric electric fields, since if they were the same then the equation would equal 1. <STRONG>IF THE CAPACITOR IS PARALLEL PLATES</STRONG>, then the electric field equations for both values (as noted in Rule 210) is equal to σ / ε, and since charge and area will remain the same regardless of a dielectric, then ε must be the only thing that changes. Note that the electric permittivity of the non-dielectric vacuum electric field is, indeed, the Permittivity of Free Space.
      <!--Some of the most belabored notes ever taken in human history. With every sentence, I made some discovery or realization that led to me going back and revising some old Rule for twenty minutes, making meticulous and careful changes to reflect that revisal everywhere that that Rule was referenced. I have never been happier.-->

      <br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: The derivation of this equation is a simple multi-step process: The first step is to use the derivative form of the work of a charged particle equation (see Rule 207), justified by imagining, for the sake of argument, <!--let's say, theoretically, that you know the rules, and so do I--> that an infinitesimally small charge is moving from one plate to the other. This allows us to find the work of said charge, which just so happens (inherently<!--it inherently is-->) to be the electric potential energy of the capacitor as a whole.

      $$W = \int_{0}^{Q} \Delta V \, dq$$
      
      
      Then, the variables of the capacitance equation (see Rule 212) can be substituted in and the integral solved.
      
      $$\frac{Q^2}{2C} - \frac{\theta^2}{2C}$$
      
      Which, of course, leads right back where one started after some further simplification and substitution.
      
      <br><br>
      
      The energy (read: electric potential energy) stored in the electric field of the capacitor is equal to the amount of work needed to move the charges from one plate to the other.
