Charge causes matter to experience an electric force (see section XII.III). Because the terms "negative" and "positive" are used to denote charge, summing charges is very simple when one needs to determine net charge.<br><br>

The character '<strong>q</strong>' is used to denote the net charge on an object.

        </strong> The '<strong>Coulomb</strong>' is the SI unit for Electric Charge. Specifically, it is defined as the "amount of electric charge  transported by a current of one ampere flowing for one second" (see definitions of each new term, they are gone over in more depth later on).<br><br>

By itself, a Coulomb is a huge amount of charge - charged particles like protons and electrons have electric charges many orders of magnitude smaller than a single Coulomb. Two objects, each with one Coulomb of charge, located one meter apart, experience an electric force (see section XII.III) of roughly nine billion newtons.</div><br><br>
        
	    
	    <strong><a href="#ExcessChargeDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ExcessChargeDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Excess Charge</font></strong>: The state of an object being more positively or negatively charged due to a lack or oversupply of negatively-charged electrons, the movement of which can be facilitated by rubbing objects together (<u>charging by friction</u>). Since positive ions are fixed in place, an object can only change in charge through the removal or addition of negative charges.<br><br>
	    
	    An "excess positive charge" is slang for an electron deficit, while an "excess negative charge" means an oversupply of electrons.

Example: Rubbing a balloon against one's hair will cause the electrons to move from the hair to the balloon (a transfer faciliated by rubbing), causing the balloon to stick to the hair. Furthermore, since each hair will become more positively-charged, they will repel one another, causing one's hair to stick up and separate.

        </strong> An <strong>atom</strong> is the smallest unit of matter retaining the chemical properties of its element. It is composed of a dense <strong>nucleus</strong> with Protons and Neutrons, and surrounded by orbitals of Electrons.<br><br>

Electrons & Protons are small <u>particles</u> (e.g., specks of mass) that carry an <em>electric charge</em> with a magnitude of ~1.69 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, which is referred to as the <strong>"Elementary Charge"</strong>. Protons are positively charged, while electrons are negatively charged.<br><br>

Electrons are elementary particles, indivisible by nature, while protons and neutrons are composed of <strong>quarks</strong>, the REAL smallest particles. Specifically, the proton has two up quarks and one down quark.<br><Br>

The up quark has a charge of +(2/3)e, while the down quark has a charge of -(1/3)e. Thus, the net quark of a proton is +e.<br><br>

The neutron, being composed of one up quark and two down quarks, has a net charge of 0. If this were not the case, the neutron would not be electrically neutral, and the nucleus of an atom would tear apart as the protons would repel from one another without the stabilizing force of the neutrons. <br><br>

The electron, being an elementary particle (defined below), just has a net charge of -e.</div><br><br>

        </strong> There is an equation relating net charge and elementary charge (or any quantifiable proportion of elementary charge), useful for determining how many excess charge carriers it would take for a specific net charge to be achieved:<br><br>

        <strong>q = n × e</strong><br><br>

        </strong> Charge is <strong>quantized</strong>, meaning that it must come in discrete quantities, integer multiples of the elementary charge. This is because the 'net charge' of an object is the product of having more or fewer charged particles, and thus only multiples of the elementary charge are possible (since elementary particles are indivisible).<br><br>

Using the net/elementary charge relation (see Rule 159), one can find that it is impossible for an object to have a net negative charge of 2.00 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, as such a net force would require 1.25 electrons, violating quantization.</div><br><br>

        </strong> When the atoms of a conductor form a solid, some of their outermost (and most loosely held) electrons become free to wander about within the solid, leaving behind positively charged atoms (positive ions). These wandering electrons are known as <strong>conduction electrons</strong>. There are practically no free electrons in a nonconductor, since those electrons are tightly bound to their atoms.<br><br>
        
        Knowledge of the "mobility of charge" within conductors, and conductors alone, is fundamental for comprehending concepts in Electric Field and Charge-Flux Law type questions - see Rule [[[. [[[this will be the bottom notepad Rule]]]

        </strong> <strong>Law of Electric Force (Coulomb's Law)</strong>: VECTOR.<br><br>

<u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Newtons.<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>

<strong>F<sub>e</sub> = (k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub>) / (r²)</strong><br><br>

<strong>F<sub>e</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric force that exists between two charged particles.<br>
<strong>k</strong> = The Coulomb constant, equal to 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²). <br>
<strong>q<sub>1</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 1, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>q<sub>2</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 2, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The distance between the centers of charge of the two objects.

<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Coulomb's Law, hereafter referred to as the Law of Electric Force, enables one to find the magnitude of the Electric Force with respect to two particles.<br><br>

Note that this equation looks very similar to <!--hella like--> the Universal Law of Gravitation (see Rule 142). Accordingly, k (the Coulomb constant) functions similar to G (the Gravitational constant), being equal to (N × m²) / (a particular composition property of mass)². Clearly, since the Coulomb constant is 20 orders of magnitude stronger than the Gravitational constant, the Electric Force between objects is much more powerful than their Gravitational attraction. F<sub>e</sub> &gt;&gt;&gt; F<sub>g</sub>.<br><br>

If the calculated Electric Force has a <strong>Negative Value</strong>, then it is an <u><em>attractive force</em></u>. If the Electric Force has a <strong>Positive Value</strong>, then it is a <u><em>repulsive force</em></u>. This is quite obvious upon momentary consideration - a negative and a positive charge will always produce a negative, and thus attractive force, which matches the Law of Charges that opposite's attract. Thus also follows for repulsive like charges.

You regain that state of mind that, that creative flow specific to that topic.-->

With charges, the fundamental concept to understand in applying the Law of Electric Force <!--in any circumstance-->is that in order to derive any useful information (depending on the question, but in general), you must determine the effect of the electric force on the individual point charges. Specifically, you must be able to determine the direction the charges will move in as a result of the force.<br><br>

The Law of Electric Force determines the repulsive or attractive force acting on both charges, since they're a Newton's Law Force Pair (see Rule 76). However, in addition, you must utilize this information to determine the direction of the movement of each charge. If you have a proton on the left and an electron on the right, the proton will move rightward and the electron leftward as they attract toward one another. If you have two electrons, they will move in opposite directions away from one another.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Permittivity of Free Space</strong>:<br><br>The Coulomb Constant, 'k', 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²), used in such equations as the Law of Electric Force (see Rule 162) and all it's applications, has a special fixed relationship with another constant. This other constant is  the <strong>permittivity constant</strong>, also just known as the <strong>permittivity of free space</strong>.<br><br>

It is represented as ε<sub>0</sub> ("Epsilon Naught"), and is defined using the following relation:<br><br>

<strong>(1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) = k</strong><br><br>

<strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br>
<strong>k</strong> = The Coulomb constant, equal to 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²).<br><br>

This, of course, can be substituted in for 'k' in any applicable equation. Furthermore, ε<sub>0</sub> itself appears in several equations by itself, most notably the Charge-Flux Law (see Rule 185). The reasons for the usage of Coulomb's Constant at all is a matter of historical decisioning.<br><br>

The actual meaning of this 'permittivity of free space' value, is that it measures how dense an electric field, in relation to an electric charge, will be "permitted" to form.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>GROUND.</strong><br><br>

All excess charges can quickly be diffused through the usage of a <strong>Ground</strong>. A Ground is any sort of release point (if excess negative) or gain point (if excess positive) for the excess charges of a system: an ideal ground is an infinite well (see VII.VI) of charge carriers - such a requirement is effectively met by the Earth.<br><br>

An <strong>Earth Ground</strong> is created when a circuit has a physical connection to the earth, in order to sink (lose) or source (obtain) electrons through the earth itself. The Earth has a practically infinite number of electrons that can be used to balance out a circuit/system, pulling from or giving to it. Relative to very small charged systems, the human skin could serve as a ground as well.<br><br>

The end result of a ground is an electrically neutral system.<br><br>

In electrical engineering, all circuits require a Ground to function - it is often referred to as "GND", and has its own symbol for use in diagrams (see Rule [[[). In many electrical situations, without the availability of a physical connection to the Earth, a "<strong>Floating Ground</strong>" can be used, which simply serves as a type of '0V reference line' (see def. of Voltage) that acts as a return path for current back to the negative side of the power supply.</div><br><br>

        </strong> There are two distinct categories, processes under which charge is transferred. Specific means of transfer, like charging by friction (rubbing) fall under these wider processes. These processes are <strong>Conduction</strong>, and <strong>Induction</strong>.<br><br>

<strong>Conduction</strong>:<br><br>

This is the transfer of charge in which current flows because of the electric field. There are only two requisites for an object to be charged by conduction, through another object:<br><br>

1. The objects have to touch.<br><br>

2. The objects must, after touching, have the same sign of net charge.<br><br><br>

<strong>Induction</strong>:<br><br>

This is the transfer of charge in which a changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force (see Rule [[[), resulting in an <em>induced</em> charge. It is not important to fully understand what an "electromotive force" is right now, just that it is the electric force that drives current through a circuit.
<br><br>

There are only two requisites for an object to be charged by conduction, and they are the eact opposite of conduction:<br><br>

1. The objects do not touch.
<br><br>

2. The objects must finish with opposite signs of net charge.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Polarization</strong>:<br><br>

Polarization is the process through which the charges within objects (and thus their associated particles) align themselves in such a way that there becomes a net attractive force, as a result of attraction & repulsion from an object with excess charge.<br><br>

Polarization doesn't change the net charge of the object, but rather has to do with how charges rearrange themselves within the object.<br><br>

The process itself is simple: When an object with an excess charge approaches a neutral object, the like charges will repel and the opposite charges will attract (the electrons being the sole moving particles, moving either in front of or behind the protons). Since the opposite charges will be closer to the charges of the object than the like charges, by the Law of Electric Force, there will be a net attractive electric force, since the opposite charges have a smaller 'r' value than the like charges.<br><br>

This is the reason that balloons stick to walls once they have an excess negative charge. The wall, as an insulator without free electrons, cannot "attract" the charge of the balloon. Instead, the charges in the wall rearrange themselves and end up with that net attractive force.<br><br>

Electric force due to polarization is small - objects with small masses, like balloons and aluminum cans, can be held in place and rolled respectively using only a small electric force.<br><br>

Electric force caused by the polarization of a conductor is typically larger than a polarized insulator. This is because electrons in insulators are bound in their atoms, while electrons in conductors are able to move to the opposite side of the object.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Shells:</strong><br><br>
        
        The nature & positioning of the charges of <strong><em>shells</em></strong>, spherical entities of a specified thickness and a hollow interior, differs depending on whether the shell is a conductor or insulator - there is no other possibility.<br><br><!--unironically took an hour of brainpower to crank out these words.-->

<strong>Conductive</strong> shells spread out all excess charge (read: electrons) uniformly over the external surface of the shell. This is because the conduction electrons of the conductor (see Rule 161) and the excess charge electrons will repel from one another, causing the excess charge electrons to spread over and uniformly distribute across the farthest possible surface.<br><br>

This concentration of charge on the external surface is the same for both positive and negative excess charge. If there is an excess positive charge (imagine the conduction electrons have been removed), then the positive charge will then spread uniformly across the surface.<br><br>

In the state of uniform charge distribution, the conductor will be in a state of <em>electrostatic equilibrium</em> - see Rule [[[ for a complete explanation involving Electric Fields.<br><br>

<strong>Nonconductive</strong>/Insulating shells, which do not allow free movement of charge, bind electrons to their atoms and thus do not move to redistribute excess charge. When an excess charge is added, there are conduction electrons that would even allow for the charge to be moved, and so the excess charge will simply remain wherever it is placed.<br><br>

Thus, the excess charge <em>can</em> be uniformly distributed if that is the state in which it is added, and questions oftentime instruct the physicist<!--that's you!--> to assume such a condition. However, if the charge is concentrated in a particular region, it will not naturally redistribute itself as it would in a conductor.<br><br>

Nonconductive shells are <em>not</em> in a state of electrostatic equilibrium (see Rule [[[), unlike Conductive shells.

        </strong> <strong>Shell Theorems of Electric Force:</strong><br><br>
Akin to the Shell Theorem for Internal Gravitation (see Rule 151), there are TWO Shell Theorems for Electric Fields - yet another similarity between electric force and gravitational force (see Rule 162 for the first). They are relatively straightforward, but are only applicable under the specified conditions.<br><br>

Fundamental to the understanding of these theorems is the nature of charge distribution on shells, which itself depends on whether the shell is conductive or not. See Rule 169 for a full treatment of these principles.
<br><br>

<strong>1.</strong> A charged particle <u><strong>outside</strong></u> of a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface (e.g., a conductor) is attracted or repelled as if the shell’s charge were concentrated as a particle at its center. This is assuming the charge on the shell is much greater than the charge of the particle, thus not interfering with the distribution of charge on the shell (an issue detailed in Rule 169).

<br><br>

<strong>2.</strong> A charged particle inside a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface (e.g., a conductor) will have no net force acting on it due to the shell. The charge from the particle cancels out with an equivalent portion of charge from the shell, which is added in addition to the charge on the surface of the shell as to maintain balance and symmetry, a mechanism detailed in Rule [[[[the future electrostatic equilibrium rule]]].

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: An Electric Field is a<!--the--> field in space surrounding a charged object, in which the object's electric force has strength.<br><br>

Electric fields have their direction expressed in the form of lines, the nature of which is elucidated in Rule 173. <u><em>Naturally</em></u> (meaning without the interference of another electric field), these lines, which originate at every point of the object's surface, will be perpendicular to the object and will point radially outward or inward (depending on the charge sign) forever without bending - the electric field of a point charge, for example, will shoot off in every direction in such a way. The direction and lines themselves, however, can be influenced as a result of the Law of Charges and can bend accordingly - see Rule 173.



<br><br>
<!--"Uniform" electric fields have all-->

Technically, the given equation dictates that the electric field is the "amount of electric force per charge at a point in space", the ratio between the electric force of the charge and the magnitude of the charge itself. All charge creates an electric field in relation to its electric force.<br><br>

The reason an exact magnitude value can be determined for an electric field (an inherently emanating and changing entity), as is done in the given equation, is because the magnitude being found is that of the strength of electric field at a particular point, denoted by the electric force experienced by the charge placed at that point.

        </strong> <strong>Electric Field Lines</strong>:<br><BR>

<strong>1.</strong> The lines of attraction in an electric field always point away from the positive charge (origination) and toward the negative charge (termination). Thus, the lines always point in the direction in which the test charge would experience an electric force.<br><Br>

<strong>2.</strong> The # of electric field lines per unit area is proportional to the electric field strength. Therefore, a higher density of electric field lines means a higher electric field strength.<br><br>

<strong>3.</strong> Electric field lines always start perpendicularly to the surface of the charge, and start on a positive charge and end on a negative charge (unless there is more of one charge, in which case some lines would start/end infinitely far away).<br><br>

<strong>4.</strong> Electric field lines never cross.<br><br>

Use the test charge (a positive entity - see the <a href="#TestChargeDef">definition</a>) as the sample particle, for the sake of illustrating this point.<br><br>

When the test charge (standardized as positive) is placed in the field of a positive point charge, the test charge will be repelled from the point charge. Electric force projects radially outward from the positive point charge, decreasing in magnitude as distance increases.<br><Br>

On the flip side, if the point charge is negative, then the test charge will be attracted toward the point charge. All of the arrows will point radially inward toward the negative point charge.

        </strong> A <strong>Continuous Charge Distribution</strong> (CCD) is a simple concept that elaborates the simple 'point' model of charges into one that uses calculus to account for more chargetype possibilities, furthering our all-consuming journey in human knowledge.<br><br>

All a 'continuous charge distribution' is, is a charge that <em>isn't</em> a point charge; e.g., a charge with a shape and an electric charge continuously distributed throughout the object. <!--The shape and charge of the CCD will, of course, hugely impact the strength of the electric field at various points.--><br><br>

The electric field that exists around a continuous charge distribution can be determined through a rethinking of the standard Electric Field-Law of Electric Force combined equation (see Rule 171), using Calculus:<br><br>

Since the charged object is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimally small point charges ('dq' representing them individually), the therefore infinite number of electric fields can be calculated using an integral.

$$E_{CCD} = k \int \frac{dq}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

<strong>k</strong> = The Coulomb constant, equal to 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²).<br><br>
<strong>dq</strong> = The infinitesimally small point charges, of which there is an infinite number of.<br><br>
<strong>r</strong> = The distance between the infinitesimal charge dq and the point where the electric field is being calculated. Unlike the Law of Electric Force, this r is a function that varies depending on the charge, since there is technically an <em>infinite</em> number of charges (dq).<br><br>
<strong>r&#x302;</strong> = The unit vector pointing from dq (whichever charge) toward the test charge - this is most applicable post-integral, when you can have a test charge to calculate the strength of the electric field with respect to. The direction points radially outward for positive dq, and inward for negative dq.<br><br><br>

There are very specific use cases for this integral: it is not applicable everywhere. See Rule 175 for a detailed treatise on this cases and their exceptions.

The limits of integration of the integral are specific to each problem and can be determined through ingenuity and through the power of the indomitable human spirit.<br><br>

That pesky 'dq' thing can be switched out by taking the derivative of any of the charge densities (see <a href="#LinearChargeDensity">linear</a>, <a href="#SurfaceChargeDensity">surface</a>, and <a href="#VolumetricChargeDensity">volumetric</a>), depending on what one is looking for.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <!--the android rule. one of my greatest masterpieces, a testament to my power of elucidation. unironically took me 4 hours of writing and revision as I was learning a concept for the first time.-->
The given integral equation for CCDs (continuous charge distributions, see Rule 174) is only applicable when <u>every infinitesimal charge has its electric field pointing in the same direction when it is pointing toward the test point</u>. For example: when the CCD is a flat line, and the test charge is on it's same axis.<br><br>

There are some workarounds in which the above stipulation is technically still respected, allowing the integral to still be used even for shapes like rings. This is when all components in all other directions cancel out, leaving only the components in a specific direction. For example, in a uniformly charged ring, the horizontal components of the field from symmetric charge elements cancel, leaving only the vertical (axial) component.<br><br>

When all fails, and the direction of the electric at test charge P is simply not the same for every charge dq on the ring, then take the derivative of both sides of the equation (giving d<span class="vecteur">E</span>) and try to see if any components cancel eachother out anywhere - in order to find the components, use the direction of the electric field from or toward the test charge (remember: the direction points radially outward for positive dq, and inward for negative dq), and imagine that beyond the test charge or dq, wherever the direction points, the direction line continues - this extended line segment represents d<span class="vecteur">E</span>, which can then be broken into components (which will hopefully cancel out in one direction). If there are equal negative and positive dq's in a particular direction, then it cancels out. Ideally, the direction that doesn't cancel out should only a single sign no matter the direction/origin of the dq.<br><br>

<!--halfway between android and human-->

Generally, the dq electric field values in a particular direction 'cancelling out' is the result of a symmetry created by the placement of the point charge. For example, a point charge placed somewhere along the axis of the center of the ring.<br><br>

If one has succeeded in cancelling out, then they would be able to proceed with all the necessary moving of sines or cosines (resultant from the components) and the general transfiguration of terms dependent on the characteristics of the problem itself. After one has been able to simplfy and reduce everything into only one real variable on one side (every other symbol just being a constant), then both sides can be integrated, creating a problem-specific version of the hyper-generalized CCD integral equation (see Rule 174).
<br><br>

All of this component business requires that there be some reference position, a known x-axis and y-axis positioning in relation to the given CCD and point charge that can be used to derive the components from.

        </strong> Note that the farther you get from a finite continuous charge distribution, the more the electric field caused by the CCD<!--thing--> matches the electric field caused by a point charge (as in, the simplified Law of Electric Force + Electric Force equation from way back when (see Rule 172)).

        </strong> Always be aware of what constants/variables are much much greater than others. In end game integrals, such as in CCD-type problems (see Rule 175), this can totally simplify whole entire parts of your equation by just thinking of the lesser variable as zero (where it is left alone and not acting as a coefficient). Of course, this mandates the usage of the approximation symbol (≈) for your answer.</div><br><br>

An <strong>Electric Dipole</strong> is an arrangement of two particles (point charges) with equal charge magnitudes but opposite signs. The particles are separated by distance <strong><em>d</em></strong> and lie along the <strong>dipole axis</strong>, an axis of symmetry going through both particles.<br><br>

<!--C.A.S. - Dreaming Of You-->
A simple graphic of what this entails is seen below:

<!--IGOR-->
The electric field produced by a dipole is determined using the following equation:<br><br>

<strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span> = (1 / 2πε<sub>0</sub>) × (qd / z³)</strong><br><br>

<strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).<br>
<strong>q</strong> = The absolute value of the charge of either particle.<br>
<strong>d</strong> = The distance between the particles.<br>
<strong>z</strong> = The distance between the point P and the dipole midpoint (d/2).<br><br>

There is a simple proof of this equation, done through finding the strength of the net electric field produced by the two particles at an arbitrary point P along the dipole axis. It can be found <a href="/Physics/img/DipoleProof.png">here</a>.<br><br>

The internal force on the electric dipole (<span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span><sub>net</sub>) will equal to zero, since the attractive forces between the particles are equal and opposite in magnitude, forming a Newton's Third Law Force Pair.<br><br>

Even beyond that, this is relatively clear when considering how at distant points, the electric fields of the oppositely charged particles will increasingly cancel eachother out.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electric Dipole Moment</strong>:<br><br>

The 'qd' from the Dipole Electric Field equation (see Rule 178) is known as the <strong>Electric Dipole Moment</strong>, and can have the value '<span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span>' substituted in for it. It has the unit of the coulomb-meter, of course.<br><br>

The Dipole Moment is defined as the magnitude of the dipole, purely a matter of charge and distance. This is separate from the magnitude of the electric field of the dipole at a point - that already has its own equation established, see Rule 178. The electric field generated by the dipole is proportional to the dipole moment, though they are <u>always</u> in opposite directions, since the electric field points from the positive charge to the negative charge.<br><br>

<!-- What is significant about it, however, detached from it's dictionary definition, is how it effectively functions both centrally and independently to the electric field equation, highlighted in Rule 179.

no idea where I was going with this. too tired for this nonsense.-->

The Electric Dipole Moment is to the Dipole Electric Field equation, what the Discriminant is to the Quadratic Formula (see Math Rule 33), perhaps even to a further degree in which the electric dipole moment can be considered even more important than it's forebear.<br><br>

The direction of <span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span> is simply the axis on which the dipole resides, while the <em>sense</em> (see Math Rule [[[) is pointing from the negative toward the positive charge of the dipole.

In defining "<strong>Electric Flux</strong>", the focus of this section, one must understand a fundamental reconsideration of how one views <em>electric fields</em> themselves - if not, the following definitions and descriptions of Electric Flux will seem nonsensical.<br><br>

First, note that the previous usage of electrical fields treated them like a structured object, a <em>vector</em> field, in which every point in space around it has a magnitude and a direction in relation to the field. In this mindset, an electric field is limited to just being a function that varies with spacial positioning.<br><br>

The new, super <!--graphic--> ultra modern rethinking of electric fields, treats them as a <u>measurement of an amount</u> - something that can be summed up, through integration. By saying "the amount of electric field", what this statement is really referring to is the cumulative <em>influence</em> of the electric field across a given area - in relation to electric flux, the cumulative influence of the electric field passing through a surface.<br><br>

This use of language is jarring at first, but can be quickly accustomed to by the young physicist. Before, electric fields were solely used in the form of a countable noun (like "apples") - now, they can also be used in the form of an uncountable noun (like "knowledge"). Without further ado:<!--<br><br><br>-->

        </strong> <strong>Uniform Electric Flux</strong>: SCALAR.<br><br>

<u><strong>Units</strong></u>: (Newtons × Meters²) / Coulombs
<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>
<strong>Φ<sub>E</sub> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span> × <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> × cos(θ)</strong>
<br><br><br>

<strong>Φ<sub>E</sub></strong> = The magnitude of Electric Flux over a Uniform Electric Field (see definition below).<br><br>

<strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span></strong> = The magnitude of a uniform electric field, the amount of which (see Rule 181) is measured over a surface and not just at an individual point in space (though, being uniform, it will have the same strength at any individual point in space). Given how the existing Electric Field equation (see Rule 171) only specifically calculates the magnitude of an electric force at a point, this equation is overly idealized in assuming a <em>uniform</em> electric field (therefore not a point charge or anything similar). <br><br>

<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> = The magnitude of the area of the surface through which the uniform electric field is passing. AREA, not VOLUME (explained in def.).<br><br>

<strong>θ</strong> = The angle between the directions of the electric field and the direction of the area (area having its direction perpendicular to the plane, and directed outward for closed surfaces). This value, given that all other values in the equation are positive magnitudes, determines whether the flux is positive or negative.<br><br><br>
<!--they say I'm a yapper but I'm bad with words -  One Lacabe = one word per hour. If I speak any faster, it is because I am saying nonsense, don't listen to a word I say. It is with extreme effort I produce HumanKnowledge essays.-->

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: <strong>Electric flux</strong> is the measure of the <em>amount of electric field</em> (see Rule 181) which passes through a defined area. The given equation is specifically for uniform electric fields, something that is totally idealized and never really happens in reality.<br><br>

This equation in particular is the result of a dot product between the electric field and the surface - this is why the result of the equation is a scalar, and why a cosine is used for the theta.<br><br>

Because this equation is a dot product, that means the two variables are vectors, both with magnitude and direction. Area, the result of a cross product between two vectors (see Math Rule [[[), has a direction normal to the plane of the area, just like how the direction of angular velocity is normal to the plane in which the object is rotating (see Rule 53).<br><br>

Note that this equation uses <strong>AREA</strong>, not VOLUME. When the electric field is passing a multi-sided object, the electric flux must be determined for each side of the object and summed thereafter, forming Φ<sub>total</sub>.<br><br>

Generally, using this equation to determine electric flux is optimal when the flux is passing through some sort of <u>closed surface</u> (see Rule 184).

        </strong> If the surface of which the electric field is passing through is perpendicular to the electric field, then since the angle created between the surface and the field will be 90° (and as cos(90) = 0), there will be a net zero electric flux acting upon that surface. This is true for both uniform (see Rule 182) and nonuniform (see Rule 185) electric fields.</div><br><br>

        </strong> When an electric field is going <em>into</em> a closed surface (like an object), the electric flux is negative. When an electric field is coming <em>out</em> of a closed surface, the electric flux is positive. This is the rule of thumb that emerges from the cosine of the uniform electric flux equation (see Rule 175).</div><br><br>

        </strong> Nonuniform Electric Fields are the standard form of Electric Fields: a field emanating outward (from a point charge or CCD), decreasing in strength with distance (symbolized in the 'r' of the Law of Electric Force (see Rule 162)).<br><br>

A new equation, an adapted form of the Uniform Electric Flux equation (see Rule 182) will account for this previously irreconcilable difference. Again, <!--in the same vein--> as was done for Electric Fields with Continuous Charge Distribution (Rule 174), this adaptation/rethinking will be done using Calculus.<br><br>

Infinitesimally small areas of the surface plane, d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>, will replace <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>.<!--Likewise--> Correspondingly, infinitesimally small fluxes dΦ<sub>E</sub> (created by the electric field) will pass through d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>.<br><br>

Substituting these values into the original uniform equation (see Rule 182), and then integrating both sides, will produce the new, revolutionary Nonuniform Electric Flux equation (though you could use it for uniform fields if you really wanted to):<br>

$$\Phi_E = \oint \vec{E} d\vec{A} \cos\theta = \frac{q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\varepsilon_0}$$


<strong>Φ<sub>E</sub></strong> = The electric flux through a closed surface.<br><br>

<strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span></strong> = The magnitude of a uniform electric field, measured in relation to its strength at the infinitesimally small area (essentially a point) d<span class="vecteur">A</span>.<br><br>

<strong>d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span></strong> = An infinitesimally small area of the surface plane, each of which is collectively represented by d<span class="vecteur">A</span> in the integral.<br><br>

<strong>θ</strong> = The angle between the directions of the electric field and the direction of the infinitesimally small area d<span class="vecteur">A</span> (area having its direction perpendicular to the plane, and directed outward for closed surfaces). This value, given that all other values in the equation are positive magnitudes, determines whether the flux is positive or negative.<br><br>

<strong>q<sub>enclosed</sub></strong> = The charge enclosed in the Gaussian Surface (see Rule 186).<br><br>

<strong>ε<sub>0</sub></strong> = The Permittivity of Free Space, equal to 8.85 × 10⁻¹² (C²) / (N × m²).  (see Rule 164).<br><br><br>




This equation is known as Gauss's Law, hereafter referred to as the <strong>Charge-Flux Law</strong>. This law, in serving nonuniform electric fields (all real ones), relates electric flux through a "Gaussian surface" to the charge enclosed by said surface.<br><br>

The shapes of these surfaces can be specifically chosen for characteristics that significantly simplify calculations in specific problems. See Rule 186 for what these characteristics entail.<br><br>

The loop on the integral sign denotes a <strong>closed surface integral</strong> (see Math Rule [[[), meaning that one must integrate over the entire closed surface to get the net flux through the surface.<br><br>

The only major difference from this to integrating normally is that you essentially have to sum the normal integrals of each side of the object. This must be done every time!

<!--E.g., just integrate as normal, but know that this new integral symbol has SYMBOLISM and MEANING that makes it unique and special.<br><br>--></div><br><br>

        </strong> A <strong>Gaussian surface</strong> is a three-dimensional closed surface in which flux of any kind is calculated.<br><br>
        
        Generally, these surfaces, when used in problems, are imaginary, though, <u>according to legend</u>, they could be real physical surfaces. Such an event, apart from the surface coinciding exactly with an actual physical surface (in which case there would be no point bothering with the Gaussian surface at all), is never used or asked for ever, and thus one should always consider Gaussian surfaces as nonexistent, imagined surfaces without the burden of it's own charge conflicting with that of another (as is the case with shells that have internal point charges).<br><br>
        
      In most cases, all references to a "Gaussian Surface" can be replaced by a simple description of a closed surface - there is <u></u>nothing particularly unique or individual the distinguishes a ""Gaussian"" surface from any other imaginary closed surface. It is just a generic surface purpose-built as a template for flux calculations - the electromagnetic industry standard for surfaces that do not carry the usual electric properties of conductors or nonconductors.<br><br>
      
      Typically, the shapes of these surfaces are chosen such that the electric field generated by the enclosed charge is either perpendicular or parallel to the sides of the Gaussian surface. This greatly simplifies the surface integral because all the angles are multiples of 90 degrees and the cosine of those angles have a value of -1, 0, or 1. The spherical Gaussian surface is chosen so that it is concentric with the charge distribution, making the electric field constant for reasons outlined in Rule 188.<br><br>
      
      As long as the amount of charge enclosed in a Gaussian surface is constant, the total electric flux through the Gaussian surface does not depend on the size of the Gaussian surface.<br><br>
      
      If the net charge inside a closed Gaussian surface (q<sub>enclosed</sub>) is zero, then the net electric flux through the Gaussian surface is zero. This is because all of the electric field entering into the object exits right through the other side. There must be some charge coming from the inside of the object for there to be any electric flux.

        </strong> Gaussian surfaces, for all intents and purposes, are theoretical constructs and are exclusively used as such.<br><br><!--Only if a question/problem explicitly states that the surface should be treated as a physical solid (which is all of <u>never</u> since they will instead describe a solid object )<br><br>
        It may be stating the obvious, but understand that future me is the most clueless baboon-brained marsupial to have tread this godforsaken earth.-->
        
        Unlike regular solid shells/spheres/closed surfaces, Gaussian surfaces do not interact with nor influence internal or external charges whatsoever and cannot contribute <strong><em><u>ANY</u></em></strong> charge - they only contain/reflect charge from internal/outside sources. Charge upon the surface of a Gaussian sphere from any such outer source is unimpeded, it is just Gaussian Surfaces themselves produce none of it. Conductive and nonconductive solid spheres, which do contain charge which produce electric fields, have their own developed systems<!-- specific parameters--> for dealing with these intervening forces in calculations (see Rule [[[).<br><br>
        
        This is the result of Gaussian Surfaces purely being constructs solely intended for the calculation of the <em>magnitude</em> of the electric field or flux produced by any charged object. As such, a "Gaussian Shell" is never used, since shells only have purpose in electric field calculations when there is an internal charge to the shell that can affect the net electric field/flux at a point, which is null and irrelevant with regard to Gaussian Surfaces, which can have all spherical distances/calculations accounted for solely using Gaussian Spheres.<br><br>
        
        In effect, Gaussian Surfaces are mere mathematical, superimposed bodies exploiting symmetry, with no effect of their own on anything: bodies in space whose only purpose is the use of their positioning, whether through symmetry or whatever (see Rule 186), to calculate flux or field at a particular distance from a charge in space, free from the interference of some internal charge. </div><br><br>

        </strong> With respect to point charges, the electric field will have the same magnitude as it passes through each area d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> at a constant distance from the point charge - see Rule 172.

Thus, for all concentric entities surrounding a point charge, where each point on the circle or sphere are at a constant distance from the point charge, the strength of the point charge at each point along the entity will be constant.<br><br>

In such cases (limited specifically to circular and circularly-shaped object), the <span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span> variable of the Nonuniform Electric Flux equation (see Rule 185) can be moved outside of the integral, since it will be a constant.<br><br>

Additionally, in these cases, the cos(θ) will equal one and thus be removed, since the angle between the electric field and every area d<span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> will equal zero, since they are both outward and in the same direction.<!-- Note the absence of the cos(θ) that previously resulted from the dot product. , --></div><br><br>
