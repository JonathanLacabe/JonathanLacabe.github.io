      <strong>I<sub>instantaneous</sub> = (dq / dt)</strong><br><br>
      
      <strong>I<sub>average</sub></strong> = Average Current, the average rate at which the charge flows at a specific time.<br>
      <strong>I<sub>instantaneous</sub></strong> = Instantaneous Current, the instantaneous rate at which charge flows.<br>

      <strong>∆Q</strong> = Change in Charge, see Rule 223 for a complete analysis. Generally, referring to the positive charge (see below).<br>
      
      <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in Time.<br>
      
      <strong>dq</strong> = Instantaneous charge, the total charge which passes through a flat cross-sectional area during an infinitesimally small time dt.<br>
      
      <strong>dt</strong> = Instantaneous time (an exact time).<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Current is the rate at which charges flow through a conductor at a particular cross-sectional area and time, most commonly in the form of the aptly-named <em>conventional current</em> (see Rule 221), specifically measuring the flow of positive charge.<br><br>
      
      The rate at which charge flows through a cross-sectional area can differ over time if the current is a function of time (AC - see Rule 222), while it will always remain the same if the current is constant with respect to time (DC - also see Rule 222). As stated in Rule 222, current should be assumed to be in DC unless otherwise stated.<br><br>

	    There are several key aspects that must be remembered when dealing with current - in particular, current direction (see Rule 221) and current type (see Rule 222).<br><br>
	    
	    Electric current will only occur when there is an electric potential difference across a wire - that imbalance is what causes the electrons to be attracted to a particular side and thus for charge to move. If there is zero electric potential difference, current does not flow.<br><br>
	    
	    While current requires a potential difference to flow, the absence of current does not necessarily imply no electric potential difference. Current also depends on other annoying factors, such as whether a conductive path is available and how much resistance is present. Only if (in addition to no current) there is no resistance, and if the conductor/wire is working fine, is it safe to assume no electric potential difference.<br><Br>
	    
	    There is an alternate equation for Average Current that uses variables substituted from drift velocity (see Rule 223) and ∆Q (Rule 223), suitable for situations in which you know the material properties of the object, such as charge carrier density and drift velocity. The equation can be found in the blue section titled "Alternate Equation for Current".

        </strong> <strong>Current Direction</strong>:<br><br>

        The direction of the current, e.g. the direction in which the current is flowing, has several names and specificities that are important to understand.<br><br>
        
        In a battery, which has a positive and a negative terminal and a wire connecting the two, the standard current (without any outside interference) would flow from the negative to the positive. The electrons would be attracted to the positive end and would move toward it, obviously.<br><Br>
        
        The electrons themselves are moving towards the positive end. Thus, the negative charge is flowing toward the positive end, while the positive charge is flowing towards the negative end. <strong>Conventional Current</strong> is the current in the direction that the positive charges would flow, which would thus be in the negative direction.<br><br>
        
        <strong>In all circumstances, the assumed current of a circuit will be conventional current, with charge flowing from the positive toward the negative end/plate/terminal</strong>. In rare circumstances, a question will specify that they want another non-conventional direction (such as that of negative charge) to be considered. Always remember to express the charge as a positive value unless otherwise directed.<br><br>
        
        Positive charge moves in the opposite direction of the electrons. In this sense, several pranksters masquerading as leading textbook publishers have written that "positive charge is when negative charges flow in the negative direction", which is just a more confusing way of stating what has been explained above.<br><br><!--but god I love some people sometimes, because people are very, very special.-->
        
        <!--Of course, "positive charge" is a misnomer that really only means that the electrons are moving in a "<em>negative</em>" direction, negative meaning-->
        
        Never confuse the direction that charge is flowing in with the direction that the electrons themselves are flowing in.<Br><Br>
        
        Of course, if the charges flowing in the conductor are positive, then under conventional current, the current produced will be flowing in the same direction as the charged particles themselves.

        </strong> <strong>Types of Current</strong>:<br><br>
        There are two different types of current: Alternating Current, and Direct Current. In real life (the fantasy land in which Physics laws are unideal), AC is typically supplied to buildings from the power grid on a broader scale and then converted to DC for individual appliances. This is more practical, as DC loses power over distance, while AC does not.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Alternating Current</strong> is current that changes as a function of time, working akin to a frequency and generally as a cosine or sine wave.<br><Br>
        
        <strong>Direct Current</strong> is current that is a <u>constant</u> as a function of time. Thus, the ∆Q of any identical-length space in the conductor at any time will be the same.<br><br>
        
        Unless otherwise stated, every circuit (see Rule [[[) and application of current & voltage should be assumed to be in DC current, with current constant as it moves from the battery (Rule [[[).

      <u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Coulombs.<br><br><br>
      
      <u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br> 
      
      <strong>∆Q = n × A × ∆x × q</strong><br>
      <strong>dq = n × A × ∆x × q</strong><br><br>

      <strong>∆Q</strong> = Average Change in Charge.<br>

      <strong>dq</strong> = Instantaneous charge, the total charge which passes through a flat cross-sectional area during an infinitesimally small time dt.<br>
      
      <strong>n</strong> = Charge Carrier Density (see blue section).<br>

    	<strong>A</strong> = The cross-sectional area that the charge is passing through.<br>
    
    	<strong>∆x</strong> = [[[write out full treatise reflecting what I find out on 4/7/2025. Incorporate this knowledge into the definition, revising as necessary[[[.<br>
    
    	<strong>q</strong> = The charge per individual carrier.<br><br><br>
    
    
    <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Electric Current incorporates "Change in Charge" (∆Q or dt, depending on rate type) into its equation. This variable represents the total amount of charge that <u>passes through</u> a cross-sectional area in the conductor during a specific amount of time.<br><br>
    
    It is not a volume of the space that is being considered, rather only a slice straight through - thus is the definition of a "cross-sectional area". This is regardless of whether the charge is average or instantaneous, all that matters is how much charge is moving through <em>that infinitesimally small slice of conductor</em> in however much time.<br><br>
    
    For instantaneous current, the rate of change of charge with respect to time is taken as time approaches zero, while the cross-sectional area remains the same. For average current, the total charge that crosses through a cross-sectional area over a particular<!--finite--> amount of time is used.<br><br>
    
    Thus, ∆Q or dq equals the number of charge carriers (at a point for instantaneous and in a space for average) multiplied by the charge per carrier. Furthermore, through substituting charge carrier density times volume in for number of charge carriers, and then area times displacement in for volume, the final equation is found.<br><br>
    
    As described in Rule 221, ∆Q generally refers to the total <em><u>positive</u></em> charge moving through the cross-sectional area at a particular time, as the majority of wires/circuits described in problems use conventional current. In the rare fringe case that a problem says to calculate the negative charge, then a negative sign will be used and everything else will be the same.

      <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in Time (the time it takes for the charge to move through the displacement).<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:  

Drift Velocity is the average velocity of the charge carriers in a conductor with current. It is quite possibly the most useless concept learned in Electromagnetism. It used all of once and then never again.<!--tell 'em, dave. ps I heard this in class, I didn't just make this up--><br><br>

	The charge carriers within a conductor are always scurrying about; when there is no current, however, they are scurrying in all different directions and thus produce a net zero drift velocity.<Br><br>

When there is a current (and an electrical potential difference to produce it), then the charge carriers all (practically) begin moving in the same direction, and so a drift velocity greater than zero appears in the direction of the current.

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Ohm's Law, from here on forth referred to as the VCR Law, is the defining law relating Electric Potential Difference (Voltage), Electric Current, and Resistance.<br><br>
      
      This law applies both to the circuit (Section [[[) as a whole, as well as to the individual components of the circuit: with current always being constant within a circuit (explained in Rule [[[understandingheart[[[), it is the electric potential difference that differs with respect to particular components, calculated using resistance as well as the voltage of the wire leading toward the component (which, itelf, must be calculated backward until the wire directly after the battery).<br><br>

      Substances that follow the VCR Law are known as VCRtic substances<!--let the record show: I laughed my ass off when I thought of this term last night. 10pm-ish, april 7 2025-->, while those that do not are non-VCRtic. All substances should be assumed to be VCRtic unless otherwise stated.

	<strong>L</strong> = The object's length (e.g., the variable that when multiplied by A would produce a volume).<br>
      
      <strong>A</strong> = The cross-sectional area that the charge is passing through. Must be uniform for the entire length of the wire, see below.<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Resistance ≠ Resistivity.<br><br>

      While Resistance itself (the extent to which an object limits current flow) is a <em>physical property</em> of an object, the much cooler and less-discussed <strong>RESISTIVITY</strong> is a material property.<br><br><br>
      
      <strong>Physical Property</strong>: A property characteristic of the <em>object</em>, like Resistance. Can be measured/observed without changing the material's composition.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Material Property</strong>: A property inherent to the material composing an object - something like the metal plates of a parallel plate capacitor, or resistivity.<br><br><br>
      
      
      Resistance and Resistivity are of course closely related (directly proportional to eachother, as shown in the equation), but they refer to fundamentally different aspects of how matter resists current. The difference between Resistance and Resistivity is the difference between software and hardware.<br><br>
      
      This equation can only be used when the wire has a uniform cross-sectional area, constant over the entire length of the wire.
      
      Two objects can have the same resistivity but different resistances. They can be made of the same material, but if they have different lengths or cross sectional areas, the resistance will be different. For more information regarding the inherent proportionalities that the resistivity equation implies, see Rule 228.<!--learning about history gets one in a profound mood. Everything in the early 20th century is connected - art, literature, music, all reflecting an age and continent that was steadily marching towards its own destruction. There is an insane antediluvian feeling to it, trivialities that tie into the most devastating events to have occurred in human history, that universal moment in which all aspects of everything, every individual is involved in a single event.

      Note that resistivity is temperature dependent: as the temperature of a conductor/insulator increases, the current in the wire decreases. The exact opposite is true for semiconductors; see Rule 229 for more information.<br><br>
      
      Electrical Components with resistance usually convert electric potential energy to thermal energy which can increase the temperature of the resistor and can increase the temperature of the resistor's environment. Don't worry about this, unless told to in a problem.

        </strong> <strong>Resistance Proportionalities</strong>.

          Several proportionalities between Resistance and other variables are revealed through analysis of the Resistivity equation, divine'd<!--divine the answer--> in Rule 227.<br><br>
          
          In addition to Resistivity, Resistance is linearly proportional to the length of the resistor, which should already be intuitive since a longer resistor would inherently have greater resistance as the charges would have to travel a longer distance through the resistor.<br><Br>
          
          Furthermore, resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, obvious considering how greater cross-sectional areas have more space for the current to flow through and therefore less resistance to flow.<br><br>
          
          The greater the <strong>Resistivity</strong>, the <strong>greater</strong> the Resistance.<br>

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Electric Power is the rate at which electric potential energy is converted into nonconservative energy (namely heat, light, and sound) using an electric component like a resistor.<Br><Br>

This equation was derived as follows: The Power equation from Subsection VII.II is (W / ∆t). The electric equivalent of power would thus be is (∆U<sub>electric</sub> / ∆t). ∆U<sub>electric</sub> in terms of the electric potential difference is already known from from the original definition of voltage from Rule 200. Substituting that in produces (q × ∆V) / t, and since (q / t) equals I, the end product of P = I × ∆V is then easily achievable.<br><Br>

Note that the equation can be altered into various other (mathematically equivalent) forms by substituting in the isolated forms of I and ∆V from the VCR Rule, depending on whatever variables one has/needs. <strong>(I × ∆V) = (∆V² / R) = (I² × R)</strong>, but you only need one to derive all of the others.

        </strong> <strong>Battery:</strong><br><br>
        Batteries are the source of the electric potential difference between the positive and negative ends of a circuit. It is, thus, inherently the source of the electromotive force (when idealized), described in Rule [[[.<br><br>
        
        In a circuit diagram, a battery is represented with two plates of differing signs, with the positive and negative sides clearly labeled. When viewing a circuit, it should ALWAYS be followed as having the current start from the positive end (for the reasons originally noted in Rule [[[) and move along the circuit towards the negative end.<br><Br>

        The long line of the battery is the positive terminal, while the short line is the negative terminal.

          The electric potential difference supplied by the battery is determined by the number of "<strong>cells</strong>" within a battery. Each cell produces a fixed amount of electric potential difference, and by adding more, the total electric potential difference of the battery (and thus the circuit) will increase, allowing it to drive a greater level of current.

        </strong> <strong>Current and Voltage in a Circuit</strong>:<br><br>

        Within a circuit, the <strong>electric current</strong> will always remain constant. The reason for this is explained in Rule [[[.<br><br>
        
        The <strong>Electric Potential Difference</strong>  (Voltage) will, of course, fluctuate as the charge moves from one end of the circuit to the other, as the "difference" will inherently decrease between the two ends of the battery (for example, a "5V" circuit has an electric potential of 5 volts on the positive terminal and 0 volts on the negative terminal). Voltage will only lower, however, as the charge passes through an electrical component, and not while going through a resistance-less wire (see Rule [[[).<br><br>
        
        The difference in electric potential between the positive and negative ends of a battery is such that the electric potential <em>has</em> to decrease as the charge traverses the circuit, decreasing with every electrical component.<br><br>
        
        It is standard convention to treat the negative terminal of a battery as a <strong>zero-volt reference point</strong>, with the positive terminal having x number of volts to start with, and by the time it gets to the end of the circuit loop, reaching zero. Of course, a 9V circuit could have 10 V on the positive and 1 V on the negative (since difference is relative), but where not otherwise stated, <u>assume the circuit has the negative terminal set as a 0 V reference point</u>.

        <strong>I</strong> = The current flowing through the non-ideal battery.<br><br>
        
        <strong>r</strong> = The internal resistance of a non-ideal battery.<br><br><br>
        
        
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:
        
        Terminal Voltage is the total <em>measured</eM> electric potential difference supplied between the positive and negative terminals of the battery. Note that this represents the <em>actual</em>, measured value of the potential difference, which, in an ideal battery, would be unimpeded by such things like internal resistance and would reflect the greatest possible electric potential difference between the terminals, known as the <u>electromotive force</u> (see Rule [[[).<br><br>
        
        The difference between the terminal voltage of a non-ideal battery and the ideal electromotive force (see Rule [[[) is the electric potential difference of the internal resistance of the battery, ΔV<sub>r</sub>. This electric potential difference is then simplified into into its components by the VCR law (Rule [[[), thus creating the non-ideal equation seen above.<BR><br>

        For all non-ideal batteries, the terminal voltage across the battery will decrease as the current through the battery increases, forming an inverse relationship. As one can figure out after momentary analysis, when there is no current in a non-ideal battery, the terminal voltage would equal to that of the electromotive force (as internal resistance would equal to zero).

        </strong> <strong>Electromotive Force (emf):</strong><br><br>

        The maximum possible electric potential difference a battery can provide between its negative and positive terminals is known as the <strong>electromotive force</strong>, known as "<strong>emf</strong>" to the commonfolk. Represented using <strong>Ɛ</strong>.<br><br>
        
        In all non-ideal batteries, the emf will be greater than the actual electrical potential difference of the circuit (the <em>terminal voltage</em>, see definition), since internal resistance will screw with it and ruin the perfection. In all <strong>ideal batteries</strong> however, terminal velocity is equivalent to electric potential difference.<br><br>
        
        Importantly, note that <strong>electromotive force is not a force</strong>. The cabal PURPOSELY named it like that so that you would get confused and include it on your free-body diagram. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO. It is only a reference to the max electric potential difference, <u>not</u> a force.

        </strong> <strong>Internal Resistance</strong>:<br><br>
        
        Idealized batteries, the most commonly used in Physics, are totally without internal resistance. Batteries with internal resistance are known as <strong>"Nonideal batteries"</strong>, while any circuit that has internal resistance of any kind (whether in a battery or within a wire) is known as a "<strong>Nonideal circuit</strong>".<br><br>
        
        When a <strong>battery</strong> is said to have some sort of "internal resistance", just imagine that there is a resistor immediately following the positive terminal of the battery (with no inbetween wire). If a <strong>WIRE</strong> is said to have internal resistance, just do the same - fashion a resistor at the very beginner of the wire, and it will have the same effect.<br><br>
        
        Lowercase <strong>r</strong> is typically the symbol of internal resistance of a battery. When the internal resistance is nonzero, the electrical current will increase as the terminal voltage decreases (as ∆V<sub>t</sub> = Ɛ - I<sub>internal</sub>, see Rule [[[-1). Thus, with a nonzero internal resistance the only way to get emf equal to terminal voltage is for there to be zero current.<br><br>
        
        Most problems will deal with ideal batteries, and will otherwise inform you of such unideal attributes like internal resistance.

        </strong> <strong>The Understanding At The Heart Of Resistors</strong>:<br><br>

          Resistors are the electrical components that have the property of resistance, causing the electric current of the circuit to decrease.<br><br>
          
          The cabal has cleverly defined resistance as "the ability to resist the flow of electric current". This <!--hogwash-->loses all meaning when one discovers that electrical current is the exact same before and after passing through a resistor. It begs the question: <strong>What exactly does a resistor do?</strong><br><Br>
          
          The best way to imagine the effect of the resistor is to realize that it, through the VCR Law, will have a <em>universal effect</em>. When a charge goes through a resistor, it will indeed get slower, and thus have a lower electrical current. HOWEVER: because all the charges in the circuit are jammed packed together in a line, all of the charges behind those in the resistor will slow down, as they cannot move any faster. As a result, <u>every charge in the circuit</u> will move at the <em>exact same speed</em>.<br><br>
          
          In other words, <strong>the constant electric current of a circuit is dependent on the total resistance of the circuit</strong>. The greater the strength of a single resistor on one end of the circuit, the lesser the strength of the current throughout the <u>entire</u>. <u>circuit</u>.<br><br>
          
          It helps to not imagine the charges as individuals detached from the whole, but rather as a <strong>sludge</strong>, moving together at a constant rate.

        </strong> <strong>Resistors</strong>:<br><br>

      The electrical component that acts as an instrument of resistance to the current. It is THE resistor, nobly standing against a raging electric potential energy.<br><br>
      
      When a charge passes through a resistor, the electric potential difference will change (as potential energy gets dissipated) while the current will remain constant. Current will remain the same as after and before the resistor, conserving charge.<br><br>
      
      Consider the VCR Law (Rule [[[) on a localized scale, only considering a single resistor. In this scenario, the VCR Law would produce the specs for the state of the charge in the wire immediately following the resistor - this is the data that must be used to discern the effect of any electrical component immediately following the resistor.<br><br>
      
      Below is the standard depiction of a resistor in circuit diagrams. Occasionally, resistors will be represented as a lame rectangular box instead of a zigzag, the box being small enough that it would not be confused for a junction of wires.<br><br>

        </strong> Unless otherwise stated, all wires are considered ideal and have zero resistance.<br><br>

Under ideal conditions, wires are considered to have zero resistance, and so electrical potential difference will remain the same from one end of the wire to the other, so long as there are no intervening electric components in between. The second there is an electrical component, <em>then</em> there will be a change in electrical potential.<br><Br>

There must always be an electric potential difference between the beginning and end of the circuit, obviously. The ending Electric Potential must be different from the beginning. Otherwise, there would be no current.

        </strong> <strong>Lightbulbs:</strong><br><br>

          Where there is a symbol for a lightbulb (oftentimes denoted as a "lamp"), treat it as a resistor (Rule [[[).<br><br>The brightness of a lightbulb increases with high electric power, and decreases with low electric power, which is obvious considering that brightness is just the dissipation of heat, a euphemism for electric power (see Rule [[[).<br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electrical Load:</strong><br><br>

         The part of the circuit which converts electric potential energy into heat, sound, or light, effectively dissipating it into nonconservative energy lost to the system. This part can be the resistor or anything else that has resistance.<br><Br>
      
          The battery can <em>never</em> be a part of electrical load, because it is an electrical power source (the origin of all electric potential difference).</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Short Circuit</strong>:<br><br>

          A circuit which has a very small resistance and thus a very large current is known as a <strong>"short circuit"</strong>. This makes some unstable, since with little resistance and constant voltage the electric power can be very large and dangerous, as discernable by the equation presented in Rule 231.<br><Br>
          
          A circuit cannot be a circuit if it does not have any resistance. Judging by the VCR Law, a circuit with zero resistance would have infinite current, which is preposterous. All circuits must have some form of resistance, internal/resistor or otherwise.

        </strong> Circuits can be generalized into two specific patterns/relations that can occur between its constituent components:<br><br>

        <ol>
        	<li><strong>Series</strong>: A situation between two electrical components in which the charge going through the first component <u>must</u> go through the second component. E.g., the components form a direct path with one another.
        
        	</li><br><br>
        
        
        	<li><strong>Parallel</strong>: A situation between two electrical components in which the charge, as a result of a junction, will either go through one component or the other. The paths of the two components will then reconverge without going through another element.
        
        	</li>
        </ol><br>
        
        Below, there can be seen an example of <em>resistors</em> in series and parallel. Note that the same patterns hold for capacitors and all other components that may get into series and parallel:<br><br>
