        </strong> <strong>Electric Current</strong>: SCALAR.<br><br>
      <u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Amperes, I (Coulombs / Second).<br><br><br>
      
      <u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>

      <strong>I<sub>instantaneous</sub> = (dq / dt)</strong><br><br>
      
      <strong>I<sub>average</sub></strong> = Average Current, the average rate at which the charge flows at a specific time.<br>
      <strong>I<sub>instantaneous</sub></strong> = Instantaneous Current, the instantaneous rate at which charge flows.<br>

      <strong>∆Q</strong> = Change in Charge, see Rule 223 for a complete analysis. Generally, referring to the positive charge (see below).<br>
      
      <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in Time.<br>
      
      <strong>dq</strong> = Instantaneous charge, the total charge which passes through a flat cross-sectional area during an infinitesimally small time dt.<br>
      
      <strong>dt</strong> = Instantaneous time (an exact time).<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Current is the rate at which charges flow through a conductor at a particular cross-sectional area and time, most commonly in the form of the aptly-named <em>conventional current</em> (see Rule 221), specifically measuring the flow of positive charge.<br><br>
      
      The rate at which charge flows through a cross-sectional area can differ over time if the current is a function of time (AC - see Rule 222), while it will always remain the same if the current is constant with respect to time (DC - also see Rule 222). As stated in Rule 222, current should be assumed to be in DC unless otherwise stated.<br><br>

	    There are several key aspects that must be remembered when dealing with current - in particular, current direction (see Rule 221) and current type (see Rule 222).<br><br>
	    
	    Electric current will only occur when there is an electric potential difference across a wire - that imbalance is what causes the electrons to be attracted to a particular side and thus for charge to move. If there is zero electric potential difference, current does not flow.<br><br>
	    
	    While current requires a potential difference to flow, the absence of current does not necessarily imply no electric potential difference. Current also depends on other annoying factors, such as whether a conductive path is available and how much resistance is present. Only if (in addition to no current) there is no resistance, and if the conductor/wire is working fine, is it safe to assume no electric potential difference.<br><Br>
	    
	    There is an alternate equation for Average Current that uses variables substituted from drift velocity (see Rule 223) and ∆Q (Rule 223), suitable for situations in which you know the material properties of the object, such as charge carrier density and drift velocity. The equation can be found in the blue section titled "Alternate Equation for Current".

        </strong> <strong>Current Direction</strong>:<br><br>

        The direction of the current, e.g. the direction in which the current is flowing, has several names and specificities that are important to understand.<br><br>
        
        In a battery, which has a positive and a negative terminal and a wire connecting the two, the standard current (without any outside interference) would flow from the negative to the positive. The electrons would be attracted to the positive end and would move toward it, obviously.<br><Br>
        
        The electrons themselves are moving towards the positive end. Thus, the negative charge is flowing toward the positive end, while the positive charge is flowing towards the negative end. <strong>Conventional Current</strong> is the current in the direction that the positive charges would flow, which would thus be in the negative direction.<br><br>
        
        <strong>In all circumstances, the assumed current of a circuit will be conventional current, with charge flowing from the positive toward the negative end/plate/terminal</strong>. In rare circumstances, a question will specify that they want another non-conventional direction (such as that of negative charge) to be considered. Always remember to express the charge as a positive value unless otherwise directed.<br><br>
        
        Positive charge moves in the opposite direction of the electrons. In this sense, several pranksters masquerading as leading textbook publishers have written that "positive charge is when negative charges flow in the negative direction", which is just a more confusing way of stating what has been explained above.<br><br><!--but god I love some people sometimes, because people are very, very special.-->
        
        <!--Of course, "positive charge" is a misnomer that really only means that the electrons are moving in a "<em>negative</em>" direction, negative meaning-->
        
        Never confuse the direction that charge is flowing in with the direction that the electrons themselves are flowing in.<Br><Br>
        
        Of course, if the charges flowing in the conductor are positive, then under conventional current, the current produced will be flowing in the same direction as the charged particles themselves.

        </strong> <strong>Types of Current</strong>:<br><br>
        There are two different types of current: Alternating Current, and Direct Current. In real life (the fantasy land in which Physics laws are unideal), AC is typically supplied to buildings from the power grid on a broader scale and then converted to DC for individual appliances. This is more practical, as DC loses power over distance, while AC does not.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Alternating Current</strong> is current that changes as a function of time, working akin to a frequency and generally as a cosine or sine wave.<br><Br>
        
        <strong>Direct Current</strong> is current that is a <u>constant</u> as a function of time. Thus, the ∆Q of any identical-length space in the conductor at any time will be the same.<br><br>
        
        Unless otherwise stated, every circuit (see Rule [[[) and application of current & Voltage should be assumed to be in DC current, with current constant as it moves from the battery (Rule [[[).

        </strong> <strong>∆Q & dq</strong>: SCALAR.<br><br>
      <u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Coulombs.<br><br><br>
      
      <u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br> 
      
      <strong>∆Q = n × A × ∆x × q</strong><br>
      <strong>dq = n × A × ∆x × q</strong><br><br>

      <strong>∆Q</strong> = Average Change in Charge.<br>

      <strong>dq</strong> = Instantaneous charge, the total charge which passes through a flat cross-sectional area during an infinitesimally small time dt.<br>
      
      <strong>n</strong> = Charge Carrier Density (see blue section).<br>

    	<strong>A</strong> = The cross-sectional area that the charge is passing through.<br>
    
    	<strong>∆x</strong> = [[[write out full treatise reflecting what I find out on 4/7/2025. Incorporate this knowledge into the definition, revising as necessary[[[.<br>
    
    	<strong>q</strong> = The charge per individual carrier.<br><br><br>
    
    
    <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Electric Current incorporates "Change in Charge" (∆Q or dt, depending on rate type) into its equation. This variable represents the total amount of charge that <u>passes through</u> a cross-sectional area in the conductor during a specific amount of time.<br><br>
    
    It is not a volume of the space that is being considered, rather only a slice straight through - thus is the definition of a "cross-sectional area". This is regardless of whether the charge is average or instantaneous, all that matters is how much charge is moving through <em>that infinitesimally small slice of conductor</em> in however much time.<br><br>
    
    For instantaneous current, the rate of change of charge with respect to time is taken as time approaches zero, while the cross-sectional area remains the same. For average current, the total charge that crosses through a cross-sectional area over a particular<!--finite--> amount of time is used.<br><br>
    
    Thus, ∆Q or dq equals the number of charge carriers (at a point for instantaneous and in a space for average) multiplied by the charge per carrier. Furthermore, through substituting charge carrier density times volume in for number of charge carriers, and then area times displacement in for volume, the final equation is found.<br><br>
    
    As described in Rule 221, ∆Q generally refers to the total <em><u>positive</u></em> charge moving through the cross-sectional area at a particular time, as the majority of wires/circuits described in problems use conventional current. In the rare fringe case that a problem says to calculate the negative charge, then a negative sign will be used and everything else will be the same.

      <strong>V<sub>d</sub></strong> = Drift Velocity, the average velocity of charge carriers in a conductor.<br>

      <strong>∆x</strong> = A displacement (an actual space in the wire, as opposed to a mere cross-section).<br>
      
      <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in Time (the time it takes for the charge to move through the displacement).<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:  

      Drift Velocity is the average velocity of the charge carriers in a conductor with current. It is quite possibly the most useless concept learned in Electromagnetism. It used all of once and then never again.<!--tell 'em, dave. ps I heard this in class, I didn't just make this up--><br><br>
      
      	The charge carriers within a conductor are always scurrying about; when there is no current, however, they are scurrying in all different directions and thus produce a net zero drift velocity.<Br><br>
      
      When there is a current (and an electrical potential difference to produce it), then the charge carriers all (practically) begin moving in the same direction, and so a drift velocity greater than zero appears in the direction of the current.

      Note that conductivity is temperature dependent: as the temperature of a conductor/insulator increases, the current in the wire decreases. The exact opposite is true for semiconductors; see Rule 229 for more information.

      <strong>R = (∆V / I)</strong><br><br>
      
      <strong>R</strong> = Resistance, an electric component's ability to resist electric current, measured in Ohms.<br>

      <strong>∆V</strong> = Electric Potential Difference, measured in Volts.<br>
      
      <strong>I</strong> = Electric Current, measured in Amperes.<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Ohm's Law, from here on forth referred to as the VCR Law, is the defining law relating Electric Potential Difference (Voltage), Electric Current, and Resistance.<br><br>
      
      This law can be applied to the circuit (Section [[[) as a whole, as well as to the individual components of the circuit. You must always keep in mind, however, what two points you are finding the electric potential difference between, whether it be across a single component or from the wire before the component all the way to the negative terminal. It is in that area that the rest of the VCR Law is applied (the net resistance in that area, the current as well).<br><BR>
      
      If there are any parallel component sets (see Rule [[[) within the electrical potential difference points, then you must sum them first as to keep the current constant all throughout the space in which the VCR Law is being used.<br><br>
      
      Since current is always being constant within a circuit when non-parallel (explained in Rule [[[Current and Voltage in a Circuit[[[), it is the electric potential difference that differs with respect to particular components, calculated using resistance as well as the Voltage of the wire leading toward the component (which, itelf, must be calculated backward until the wire directly after the battery).<br><br>

      Substances that follow the VCR Law are known as VCRtic substances<!--let the record show: I laughed my ass off when I thought of this term last night. 10pm-ish, april 7 2025-->, while those that do not are non-VCRtic. All substances should be assumed to be VCRtic unless otherwise stated.

      <strong>A</strong> = The cross-sectional area that the charge is passing through. Must be uniform for the entire length of the wire, see below.<br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Resistance ≠ Resistivity.<br><br>

      While Resistance itself (the extent to which an object limits current flow) is a <em>physical property</em> of an object, the much cooler and less-discussed <strong>RESISTIVITY</strong> is a material property.<br><br><br>
      
      <strong>Physical Property</strong>: A property characteristic of the <em>object</em>, like Resistance. Can be measured/observed without changing the material's composition.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Material Property</strong>: A property inherent to the material composing an object - something like the metal plates of a parallel plate capacitor, or resistivity.<br><br><br>
      
      
      Resistance and Resistivity are of course closely related (directly proportional to eachother, as shown in the equation), but they refer to fundamentally different aspects of how matter resists current. The difference between Resistance and Resistivity is the difference between software and hardware.<br><br>
      
      This equation can only be used when the wire has a uniform cross-sectional area, constant over the entire length of the wire.
      
      Two objects can have the same resistivity but different resistances. They can be made of the same material, but if they have different lengths or cross sectional areas, the resistance will be different. For more information regarding the inherent proportionalities that the resistivity equation implies, see Rule 228.<!--learning about history gets one in a profound mood. Going through Wikipedia, where reading about Stravinsky connects to Satie connects to Cocteau connects to Rossellini connects to Einstein. All people existing at the same time, in either contact or knowledge of one another, historical figures and events that are much closer than you would have thought. Everything in the early 20th century is connected - art, literature, music, all reflecting an age and continent that was steadily marching towards its own destruction. There is an insane antediluvian feeling to it, trivialities that tie into the most devastating events to have occurred in human history, that universal moment in which all aspects of everything, every individual is involved in a single event.

      Note that resistivity is temperature dependent: as the temperature of a conductor/insulator increases, the current in the wire decreases. The exact opposite is true for semiconductors; see Rule 229 for more information.<br><br>
      
      Electrical Components with resistance usually convert electric potential energy to thermal energy which can increase the temperature of the resistor and can increase the temperature of the resistor's environment. Don't worry about this, unless told to in a problem.

        </strong> <strong>Resistance Proportionalities</strong>.

          Several proportionalities between Resistance and other variables are revealed through analysis of the Resistivity equation, divine'd<!--divine the answer--> in Rule 227.<br><br>
          
          In addition to Resistivity, Resistance is linearly proportional to the length of the resistor, which should already be intuitive since a longer resistor would inherently have greater resistance as the charges would have to travel a longer distance through the resistor.<br><Br>
          
          Furthermore, resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, obvious considering how greater cross-sectional areas have more space for the current to flow through and therefore less resistance to flow.<br><br>
          
          The greater the <strong>Resistivity</strong>, the <strong>greater</strong> the Resistance.<br>

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Electric Power is the rate at which electric potential energy is converted into nonconservative energy (namely heat, light, and sound) using an electric component like a resistor.<Br><Br>

This equation was derived as follows: The Power equation from Subsection VII.II is (W / ∆t). The electric equivalent of power would thus be is (∆U<sub>electric</sub> / ∆t). ∆U<sub>electric</sub> in terms of the electric potential difference is already known from from the original definition of Voltage from Rule 200. Substituting that in produces (q × ∆V) / t, and since (q / t) equals I, the end product of P = I × ∆V is then easily achievable.<br><Br>

Note that the equation can be altered into various other (mathematically equivalent) forms by substituting in the isolated forms of I and ∆V from the VCR Rule, depending on whatever variables one has/needs. <strong>(I × ∆V) = (∆V² / R) = (I² × R)</strong>, but you only need one to derive all of the others.

        </strong> <strong>Current and Voltage in a Circuit</strong>:<br><br>

        Within a circuit, the <strong>electric current</strong> will always remain constant when the path is undivided. On an individual level, current is constant across each electrical component (whether resistor or capacitor or whatever). The reason for this is explained in Rule [[[understandingheart[[[.<br><br>
        
        The only times in which the current running through a circuit can differ at two places is when the circuit path is divided - i.e., when the circuit has a junction (a splitting of the wires onto separate paths), with the electrical components along the paths being "<eM>parallel</em>". See Rule [[[ for more information regarding this phenomenon. The circuit will always have its paths reconverge by the time the negative terminal is reached, and so the current through both terminals is always the same.<br><br><br>
        
        The <strong>Electric Potential Difference</strong> (Voltage) will, of course, fluctuate as the charge moves from one end of the circuit to the other, as the "difference" will inherently decrease between the two ends of the battery (for example, a "5V" circuit has an electric potential of 5 Volts on the positive terminal and 0 Volts on the negative terminal).<br><br>
        
        Voltage will only lower, however, as the charge passes through an electrical component, and not while going through a resistance-less wire (see Rule [[[). Thus, the electric potential difference between the farthest extent of the wire connected to the positive terminal and the wire connected to the negative terminal will be the same as that between the terminals (the Terminal Voltage).<br><br>
        
        Electric potential decreases with every electrical component, decreasing the electric potential difference between the charge position and the negative terminal with each component passed through.<!--it does not decrease by just passing through a junction.--><br><br>
        
        It's important to note that across the different paths of a <strong>parallel set</strong> (see Rule [[[), Voltage will be the same. This is true regardless of how unbalanced the component distribution is between the paths - regardless of whether there are five components on one path and two components on the other. Thus, for parallel paths, as the Voltage is the same, if the components on the paths are not identical to eachother, then the current will differ between the two paths to compensate for the different resistance (under the VCR Law, Rule [[[), retaining the same Voltage across the paths.<br><br>
        
        It is standard convention to treat the negative terminal of a battery as a <strong>zero-Volt reference point</strong>, with the positive terminal having x number of Volts to start with, and by the time it gets to the end of the circuit loop, reaching zero. Of course, a 9V circuit could have 10 V on the positive and 1 V on the negative (since difference is relative), but where not otherwise stated, <u>assume the circuit has the negative terminal set as a 0 V reference point</u>.

        Upon occasion, a foolish question will ask you to find the Voltage/electric potential difference of a component. In these cases, just mentally rephrase the question to ask for the "Voltage <em>across</em>" the component, which is a more logical phrasing of such a question.<br><br>
        
        Of course, it is perfectly logical to ask for the current of a component, or the resistance/capacitance of a component, but since Voltage is inherently a <em>difference</em> between two points (the effect of the component on which is being measured), it is more accurate to ask for the Voltage across.

This electric potential difference is then simplified into into its components by the VCR law (Rule [[[), thus creating the non-ideal equation seen above.<BR><br>

        For all non-ideal batteries, the Terminal Voltage across the battery will decrease as the current through the battery increases, forming an inverse relationship. As one can figure out after momentary analysis, when there is no current in a non-ideal battery, the Terminal Voltage would equal to that of the electromotive force (as internal resistance would equal to zero).

        </strong> <strong>Electromotive Force (emf):</strong><br><br>

        The maximum possible electric potential difference a battery can provide between its negative and positive terminals is known as the <strong>electromotive force</strong>, known as "<strong>emf</strong>" to the commonfolk. Represented using <strong>Ɛ</strong>.<br><br>
        
        In all non-ideal batteries, the emf will be greater than the actual electrical potential difference of the circuit (the <em>Terminal Voltage</em>, see definition), since internal resistance will screw with it and ruin the perfection. In all <strong>ideal batteries</strong> however, terminal velocity is equivalent to electric potential difference.<br><br>
        
        Importantly, note that <strong>electromotive force is not a force</strong>. The cabal PURPOSELY named it like that so that you would get confused and include it on your free-body diagram. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO. It is only a reference to the max electric potential difference, <u>not</u> a force.

        </strong> <strong>Internal Resistance</strong>:<br><br>
        
        Idealized batteries, the most commonly used in Physics, are totally without internal resistance. Batteries with internal resistance are known as <strong>"Nonideal batteries"</strong>, while any circuit that has internal resistance of any kind (whether in a battery or within a wire) is known as a "<strong>Nonideal circuit</strong>".<br><br>
        
        When a <strong>battery</strong> is said to have some sort of "internal resistance", just imagine that there is a resistor immediately following the positive terminal of the battery (with no inbetween wire). If a <strong>WIRE</strong> is said to have internal resistance, just do the same - fashion a resistor at the very beginner of the wire, and it will have the same effect.<br><br>
        
        Lowercase <strong>r</strong> is typically the symbol of internal resistance of a battery. When the internal resistance is nonzero, the electrical current will increase as the Terminal Voltage decreases (as ∆V<sub>t</sub> = Ɛ - I<sub>internal</sub>, see Rule [[[-1). Thus, with a nonzero internal resistance the only way to get emf equal to Terminal Voltage is for there to be zero current.<br><br>
        
        Most problems will deal with ideal batteries, and will otherwise inform you of such unideal attributes like internal resistance.

The Voltmeter component is used to measure electric potential difference. 

It can be strategically placed in the circuit to obtain a value that reflects the Voltage across another component, as a result of Voltage being the same for all components in parallel (see Rule [[[Current and Voltage in a Circuit[[[).<br><br>

The Voltmeter must be placed in <strong>parallel</strong> with the electrical component it is measuring the 'Voltage-across' of.<br><br>

The resistance of a Voltmeter is near infinite (infinite for all intents and purposes), as it must prevent ANY current from moving onto its path (under the current divider law of Rule [[[), as otherwise it will actually provide a parallel path to the component being measured and will decrease the equivalent resistance of the circuit, increasing the current and ruining everything (and interfering with the purely observatory nature of the Voltmeter).<br><br>

        </strong> <strong>The Understanding At The Heart Of Resistors</strong>:<br><br>

          Resistors are the electrical components that have the property of resistance, causing the electric current of the circuit to decrease.<br><br>
          
          The cabal has cleverly defined resistance as "the ability to resist the flow of electric current". This <!--hogwash-->loses all meaning when one discovers that electrical current is the exact same before and after passing through a resistor. It begs the question: <strong>What exactly does a resistor do?</strong><br><Br>
          
          The best way to imagine the effect of the resistor is to realize that it, through the VCR Law, will have a <em>universal effect</em>. When a charge goes through a resistor, it will indeed get slower, and thus will have a lower electrical current. HOWEVER: because all the charges in the circuit are jammed packed together in a line, all of the charges behind those in the resistor will slow down, as they cannot move any faster. As a result, <u>every charge in the circuit</u> will move at the <em>exact same speed</em> when following an individed path (i.e., in series).<br><br>
          
          In other words, <strong>the constant electric current of a circuit is dependent on the total resistance (the equivalent resistance) of the circuit</strong>. The greater the strength of a single resistor on one end of the circuit, the lesser the strength of the current throughout the <u>entire</u>. <u>circuit</u>.<br><br>
          
          All components in series will have the same current, while it will differ between components in parallel (explained below).<br><br>
          
          <!--this following section is an excuse for me to use "sludge" in an analogy. CULT OF LUNA RULES!!!!!!!!!-->
          It helps to not imagine the charges as individuals detached from the whole, but rather as a <strong>sludge</strong>, moving together at a constant rate (the current). This sludge, when divided into multiple paths (such as through a junction, which creates parallel components along its individual paths - see Rule [[[), can indeed <em>become</em> slower in its split form along its individual paths (the division of speed of which unto the different paths in fact not being equal, but rather calculated in a specific manner (Rule [[[)), but if the path remains undivided, the sludge will always move at a constant rate.

        </strong> <strong>Resistors</strong>:<br><br>

      The electrical component that acts as an instrument of resistance to the current. It is THE resistor, nobly standing against a raging electric potential energy.<br><br>
      
      When a charge passes through a resistor, the electric potential difference will change (as potential energy gets dissipated) while the current will remain constant. Current will remain the same before and after passing through the resistor, conserving charge.<br><br>
      
      Consider the VCR Law (Rule [[[) on a localized scale, only considering a single resistor. In this scenario, the VCR Law would produce the specs for the state of the charge in the wire immediately following the resistor - this is the data that must be used to discern the effect of any electrical component immediately following the resistor.<br><br>
      
      Below is the standard depiction of a resistor in circuit diagrams. Occasionally, resistors will be represented as a lame rectangular box instead of a zigzag, the box being small enough that it would not be confused for a junction of wires.<br><br>

        </strong> Unless otherwise stated, all wires are considered ideal and have zero resistance.<br><br>

Under ideal conditions, wires are considered to have zero resistance, and so electrical potential difference will remain the same from one end of the wire to the other, so long as there are no intervening electric components in between. The second there is an electrical component, <em>then</em> there will be a change in electrical potential.<br><Br>

There must always be an electric potential difference between the beginning and end of the circuit, obviously. The ending Electric Potential must be different from the beginning. Otherwise, there would be no current.

          A circuit cannot be a circuit if it does not have any resistance. Judging by the VCR Law, a circuit with zero resistance would have infinite current, which is preposterous. All circuits must have some form of resistance, internal/resistor or otherwise.

          Capacitors store electric potential energy within their electric field, something that gives them unique properties in circuitry. The actual purpose for capacitors in doing so within a circuit, as is taught and is fundamental to Electric Engineering (see E.E. Rule [[[), has to do with Voltage regulation, as current from a battery will come in little bursts rather than in a coherent flow.<br><br>
          
          However, in freshman Physics, which deals only with the most idealized circuits imaginable, and almost entirely with DC circuits (constant current, see Rule 222), this purpose is all but neglected.<br><br>
          
          Instead, the more potent and relevant attributes of capacitors, particularly how they play into series and parallel circuits, will be described here somewhat detached from their actual purpose - indeed, this section reflects <em>how to solve problems involving capacitors</em> and their application in Physics rather than anything geared toward actual engineering.<br><br>
          
          Unless told otherwise (and as previously stated in Rule [[[), every circuit and application of current & Voltage should be assumed to be in DC current (see Rule [[[), with current constant as it moves from the battery.

        	<li><strong>Series</strong>: A situation between two electrical components in which the charge going through the first component <u>must</u> go through the second component. E.g., the components form a direct path with one another.

        The left circuit above depicts two resistors in <strong>series</strong>, while the right circuit depicts two resistors in <strong>parallel</strong>.<br><br>
        
        Finding Equivalent Resistance for series and parallel sets requires finding other relationships, involving the likes of electric potential energy and current, in order to cancel out values using the VCR Law. See the "Series" and "Parallel" sections below for how this is done, and see Rule [[[ for a truncated version that only includes the equations for quick reference.
        
        <br><br><Br>
        
        <h3><strong>Resistors in Series:</strong></h3> When two resistors are in series, the current running through them is the same:<br>
        <strong>I<sub>T</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub></strong>, where I<sub>1</sub> & I<sub>2</sub> are the currents running through the two resistors, and I<sub>T</sub> is the general current running through the terminals of the battery.<br><br>
        
        When the two resistors are in series, the electric potential difference between the wire directly before the first resistor and the wire directly after the second resistor (which would be the wires connected to the terminals if there are no other components in the circuit) is equivalent to to the summed electric potential difference across the two resistors.<br><br>
        
        In short, as depicted below, <strong>Ɛ = ΔV<sub>1</sub> + ΔV<sub>2</sub></strong>, with Ɛ being ΔV<sub>set</sub> when there are more components in the circuit than just the two resistors.<br><br>

        By substituting in values from the VCR Law into the aforementioned equation, and then canceling out current (since the current is equal everywhere in series), the following equation can be established for equivalent resistance of a particular resistor set (for an '<em>n</em>' number of resistors in series):<br><br>
        
        $$R_{\text{set series}} = \sum_n R_n = R_1 + R_2 + \dots$$
        <br>
        Thus, when a resistor is added into a series, the equivalent resistance <u>increases</u>.
        
        <br><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h3><strong>Resistors in Parallel:</strong></h3>
        
        When resistors are in parallel, the electric potential difference across each resistor is equal to that of the electric potential difference between the wire before the diverging junction and the wire after the reconverging junction:<br><br>
        
        <strong>ΔV<sub>set</sub> = ΔV<sub>1</sub> = ΔV<sub>2</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        As for the current that moves through the split paths of a junction, it <u>cannot</u> be assumed that the current will split evenly between the two paths. In fact, all that is known about the individual path currents is the conservation of charge, delineated in the following equation:<br><br>
        <!--the 2am brain is a crazy thing. I am typing relatively freely, but I was also doing so at 10pm. I may just be a night person, sadly.-->
        
        <strong>I<sub>t</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        I<sub>t</sub>, of course, is referring to the current before the diverging junction and after the converging junction. It is only ever represents the current running through the terminals if there are no other components in the circuit than the resistors in parallel.<br><br>
        
        In the same manner as was done before for series (now simply using different variables), the values of the VCR equation can be substituted into the above equation, and then have Voltage canceled out everywhere (since it was previously shown to be the same across every component). Thus, the following equation can be established, describing the equivalent resistance of 'n' resistors in parallel:<br><br>
        
        $$R_{\text{set parallel}} = \left( \sum_n \frac{1}{R_n} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots \right)^{-1}$$
        <br>
        
        I.E., for resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is equal to the <strong>inverse</strong> of the <em>sum of the inverses</em> of all resistors in the set. Remember that in order to be parallel, there must only be <u>one</u> component on each split path before they reconverge. <!--Note that this is the opposite of capacitors in parallel.--><br><br>
        
        Thus, when a resistor is added in parallel, the equivalent resistance <U>decreases</u>.

        The top circuit above depicts two capacitors in <strong>series</strong>, while the bottom circuit depicts two capacitors in <strong>parallel</strong>.<br><br>
        
        Finding Equivalent Capacitance for series and parallel sets requires finding other relationships, involving the likes of electric potential energy and charge, in order to cancel out values using the capacitance equation of Rule 212. See the "Series" and "Parallel" sections below for how this is done, and see Rule [[[ for a truncated version that only includes the equations for quick reference.
        
        <br><br><Br>
        
        
        
        <h3><strong>Capacitors in Series:</strong></h3> When two capacitors are in series, the current running through them is the same: <strong>I<sub>T</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub></strong>, where I<sub>1</sub> & I<sub>2</sub> are the currents running through the two capacitors, and I<sub>T</sub> is the general current running through the terminals of the battery.<br><br>
        
        When the two capacitors are in series, the electric potential difference between the wire directly before the first capacitor and the wire directly after the second capacitor (which would be the wires connected to the terminals if there are no other components in the circuit) is equivalent to to the summed electric potential difference across the two capacitors. In short, as depicted below, <strong>Ɛ = ΔV<sub>1</sub> + ΔV<sub>2</sub></strong>, with Ɛ being ΔV<sub>set</sub> when there are more components in the circuit than just the two capacitors.<br><br>
              <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/Physics/img/diagrams/CapacitorSeries.png"><img src="/Physics/img/diagrams/CapacitorSeries.png" alt="A simple circuit in which two capacitors are in series.

        As such, since the charges moved by the battery will have to pass through the plates of both capacitors equally, the magnitude of the charge is same for each capacitor:<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q<sub>set</sub> = Q<sub>1</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        Finally, by substituting in values from the standard capacitance equation (Rule 212) into the aforementioned equation, and then canceling out charge (since charge is equal everywhere in series), the following equation can be established for equivalent capacitance of a particular capacitor set (for an '<em>n</em>' number of capacitors in series):<br><br>
        
        $$C_{\text{set series}} = \left( \sum_{n} \frac{1}{C_n} \right)^{-1} 
            = \left( \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \dots \right)^{-1}$$
        <br>
        
        I.E., for capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance is equal to the <strong>inverse</strong> of the <em>sum of the inverses</em> of all capacitors in the set. <!--Note that this is the opposite of resistors in series.--><br><br>
        
        Thus, when a capacitor is added in series, the equivalent capacitance <U>decreases</u>.
        
        <br><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h3><strong>Capacitors in Parallel:</strong></h3>
        
        When capacitors are in parallel, the electric potential difference across each capacitor is equal to that of the electric potential difference between the wire before the diverging junction and the wire after the reconverging junction:<br><br>
        
        <strong>ΔV<sub>set</sub> = ΔV<sub>1</sub> = ΔV<sub>2</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        As for the current that moves through the split paths of a junction, it <u>cannot</u> be assumed that the current will split evenly between the two paths. In fact, all that is known about the individual path currents is the conservation of charge, delineated in the following equation:<br><br>
        
        <strong>I<sub>t</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        I<sub>t</sub>, of course, is referring to the current before the diverging junction and after the converging junction. It is only ever represents the current running through the terminals if there are no other components in the circuit than the capacitors in parallel.<br><br>
        
        Furthermore, because the charges moved by the battery to the junction are going to be split between the two paths (between the two capacitors), the charge moved by the battery to the diverging junction (and by conservation of charge, the charge at the converging junction) is equal to the sum of charges across each individual capacitor:<br><br>
        
        <STRONG>Q<sub>set</sub> = Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> + ...</STRONG><br><br>
        
        
        The values of the capacitance equation can then be substituted in for charge, leaving only Voltage and Capacitance. Since electric potential energy has already been determined to be the same for all values, it can be canceled out, leaving only the following equation for the <strong>equivalent capacitance</strong> of a set of 'n' capacitors in parallel:<br><br>
        
        $$C_{\text{set parallel}} = \sum_{n} C_n = C_1 + C_2 + \dots$$
        <br><br>
        
        
        Thus, when a capacitor is added in parallel, the equivalent capacitance <U>increases</u>.

        Kirchhoff's Laws, hereafter referred to as the Circuitry Conservation Principles (CCP), are a set of two rules that describe basic characteristics about circuitry that can be applied in practically all circumstances (all circumstances that will be faced by the junior physicist<!--never capitalize "physicist" - humanizing Physics is a disgrace-->).<br><br>
        
        There are two fundamental rules of the CCP that must always be kept in mind when doing circuitry problems: the <strong>Loop Rule</strong> and the <strong>Junction Rule</strong>, described in Rule [[[+1 and Rule [[[+2, respectively.
