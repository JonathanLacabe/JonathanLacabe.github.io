	  <hr>
	  <article>
	    <p>These are my complete notes for Newtonian Mechanics, covering such topics as Velocity, Speed, Acceleration, Free Fall, Projectile Motion, Range, and more. <br><br>I color-coded my notes according to their meaning - All numbered notes (which I call rules) are red, and include examples and the basis for understanding a topic. Definitions are written in green, and other important information (such as large-scale drawings that are better visualized than explained) was written in blue. All of this information is preserved on this page, with logical flow and breaks. I use ascii line drawings sparingly - If I can convey information or a graph using an image online, I will do so.<br><br>All of the knowledge present in these notes are filtered through my personal explanations for them, the result of my attempts to understand and study them from my classes. In the unlikely event there are any egregious errors, contact me at <a href="mailto:jdlacabe@gmail.com">jdlacabe@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	  <font color="blue"><strong>The Bare Minimum:</strong></font><br>
	  Physics is based on measurement of physical quantities: Having some expertise in dimensional analysis is crucial to be able to convert from one unit of measurement to another. There are several different systems of measurements which measure the same types of quantities, the two biggest systems being the Metric System and the Imperial System. For example, length is measured in the metric system in 'meters', while the imperial unit for length is 'feet'. Dimensional Analysis is conducted using <strong>conversion factors</strong>, which are just the ratio of units equivalent to what you are trying to convert to. For example, <br><br>(2 min) x (60 sec/1 min)<br><br> has (60 sec/1 min) as the conversion factor, converting from minutes to seconds. The conversion factor is the raetion being multiplied regardless of the coefficient of the original unit, as shown in how two minutes, 40 minutes, and 542 minutes will all have the same conversion factor when converting into seconds.

	    <font color="blue"><strong>Density:</strong></font><br>
	    The density d of a material is the mass per unit volume:<br><br> <strong>d = (m / V)</strong><br><br>The majority of the time, one will see a density listed in Kilograms (or another metric weight) per cubic meter (or another length, such as cm³). The density of water, for example, is 1.00 grams per cm³. 
	    <br><br><br>
	    
	    <font color="blue"><strong>Vertical Scaling:</strong></font><br>
	    When you have a problem such as that shown below (ignore the problem itself - it is done through integration if you must know), the "<strong>vertical scaling</strong>" is just referring to what the given value (v<sub>s</sub>) is as each y-value is multiplied by a constant, creating a ratio between the new and old scales. The old scale will almost always be a scaling of 1:1, e.g. the normal graph, and the new scale (as depicted in the image) has a ratio of 2:1 with the old graph, demonstrated by how v<sub>s</sub> is four units upward, meaning each unit is two. The exact same process can be applied to the x-axis, resulting in <strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong>.<br><br>

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 3.</font></strong> When you have squared or cubed units, you put the exponent on the outside of the individual component, given both units of the type share the same exponent: 12 mm² → m²&nbsp; = &nbsp;12 mm² × ((1 m) / (1000 mm))²<br><br><br>

	    <font color="blue"><strong>Final Example:</strong></font><br>
	    Here is a beginning problem that should be common sense to any beginning physicist well-versed in dimensional analysis:<br><br>
	    <em>Iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm³, and the mass of an iron atom is 9.27 × 10⁻²⁶ kg. If the atoms are spherical and tightly packed, <br>(a) what is the volume of an iron atom and <br>(b) what is the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms?</em><br><br>
	    Of course, you always want all of your measurements to be in the same units, so we will first convert the grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters:<br><br>
	    d = (7.87 g/cm³) × (1 kg / 1000 g) × (100 cm / 1 hr)³<br>d = 7.87 × 10³ kg/m³<br><br>Now lets move on to finding the volume of the iron atom. For this, we need to remember our previous knowns of density, mass, and volume: d = (m / V) Thus, our first step must be to isolate the volume since we already know the density and mass.
	    <br><br> (9.27 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) / (7.87 × 10³ kg/m³)<br><br>This gives us a result of 1.18 × 10⁻²⁹ m³ the volume of an iron atom.<br>Next, for part b, we need to find the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms. Using critical thinking, we can determine that this distance is in fact the diameter of the atom, which we can reverse engineer by isolating the radius from the volume equation of a sphere:<br><br>Volume of sphere = (4/3) × π × r³.<br> r = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&#8731;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">(3V / 4π)</span></span><br><br>Plugging in the known volume from answer a), we find that the radius is equal 1.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters. Since we are looking for the diameter, we multiply this distance by two and get <strong>2.82 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters</strong>.

	    <article>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Magnitude</font></strong>: The amount without direction.<br><br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Displacement</font></strong>: 
	    
	    The straight-line distance between initial and final points, also including direction. <strong>∆x</strong> is the symbol for displacement and change in position, known as position<sub>final</sub> - position<sub>initial</sub>. Can be negative, positive, in feet, meters, or anything.<br><br>
	    Displacement is a VECTOR (see section III, on vectors). It has both x and y distance, even though it is written as ∆x ("delta-x"), which is in reference to POSITION, not just the x value. <br><br>Using <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> as displacement, <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> = (<span class="vecteur"><strong>x₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>x₁</strong></span>, <span class="vecteur"><strong>y₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>y₁</strong></span>). This equation describes displacement in terms of its component vectors on the x-axis and y-axis. These component vector indicate the direction and magnitude of the displacement (also, the equation effectively uses unit vectors - see Rule 23). In order to find displacement in the graphical sense, where you have two dots on a graph (the start and endpoints) and you need to find the straight-line distance between them, this is the first step. You must find the components in the x and y directions first to find the displacement, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the x and y component vectors (see Rules 20 & 21). <br><br>If you want to find the magnitude of the displacement, the exact straight-line distance between any two points can be found with the following equation: <br>
	    |<span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>| = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">((<span class="vecteur"><strong>x₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>x₁</strong></span>)² + (<span class="vecteur"><strong>y₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>y₁</strong></span>)²)</span></span><br> Use this equation when you are prompted to find the distance or the <em>magnitude</em> the displacement - the direction can be determined by the component vectors themselves, as demonstrated in Rule 22.<br><br>
	    NOTE THAT THE DISPLACEMENT EQUATION AND SEEING DISPLACEMENT AS A VECTOR IS NOT NECESSARY IF THE OBJECT IS ONLY MOVING ALONG THE X-AXIS. If the position is only moving along the x-axis, then you only need to subtract y<sub>final</sub> by y<sub>initial</sub> to find displacement. If the equation is in 2D, then you want to use the equation as stated.
	    <br><br><br>
	    <font color="blue"><strong>Important Note</strong></font>: When used in different context, the 'Average Rate of Change' can mean different things:<br><br>
      When used with f(x): Average Rate of Change = <strong>Average Velocity</strong> = (Displacement / change in time).<br><br>
      When used with f'(x): Average Rate of Change = <strong>Average Acceleration</strong> = (Change in Velocity / change in time).<br><br>
	    Using it in relation to the second derivative would mean to take the third derivative, which is frankly ridiculous.

	    You walk two meters east. You have a displacement of 2 m east, and a distance traveled of 2 meters. Magnitude is the same.<br>If you walk 2 meters east and moon walk back, then your displacement is 0 m, directionless, magnitude is also 0. The distance traveled will always be greater or equal to the magnitude of displacement.<br><br><br> 
	    
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Velocity</font></strong>: V = (∆x / ∆t) = (change in position) / (change in time) = (x<sub>F</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>) / (t<sub>F</sub> - t<sub>i</sub>)<br>
	    Thus, velocity has both magnitude and direction.<br><br>
	    <br>
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 8.</font></strong> ALWAYS convert into the standard S.I. Units unless told otherwise.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 9.</font></strong> <strong>Speed</strong> = (total distance) / (time). MAGNITUDE ONLY. Because Velocity accounts for displacement, but speed only for distance traveled, they will only share the same magnitude when moving in a straight line. The velocity is specifically in straight-line distance, so if the line is curved, the end point and the initial point are the only things that are going to be used in a velocity calculation. However, the speed of that curve would be the length of the entire line, all of distance traveled between point a and point b. <br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Slope</font></strong>: slope = m = (rise)/(run) = (∆y / ∆x) = (change in position / change in time) = VELOCITY. See "The Truth About Velocity & Displacement" for further elaboration. The slope of a position as a function of the time graph is the velocity. The slope of a velocity vs. time graph is acceleration.<br><br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Acceleration</font></strong>: a = (∆v / ∆t) = (v<sub>F</sub> - v<sub>i</sub>) / (t<sub>F</sub> - t<sub>i</sub>)<br>
	    Since velocity is in meters over seconds, then acceleration is in (meters over seconds) over seconds, which is equal to meters over second². Acceleration, as a function of velocity, has both magnitude and direction.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 10.</font></strong> The object is speeding up whenever velocity and acceleration are in the same direction (e..g are the same sign), while it is slowing down whenever velocity and acceleration are in opposite directions/signs.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="blue"><u>The Truth About Velocity & Displacement</u></font></strong>: <br>
	     In your reading of Velocity and Slope, you have no doubt read these two truths:<br><br>
	     <strong>Velocity = ∆x / ∆t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Displacement / Change in Time)<br>
	     Slope = ∆y / ∆x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Change in Y / Change in X)<br>
	     Velocity = Slope</strong>
	     <br><br>
	    The '∆x' of slope is not referring to displacement, but rather the change in the x position. This is constant cause of confusion, but know that in the majority of cases unless expressly obvious otherwise, '∆x' is in reference to displacement, the change in position.<br>
	    Here are the two equations shown as equivalent:<br><br>
	    ∆x<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;∆y<br>
	    ━━&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;━━<br>
	    ∆t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hairsp;∆x<sub>2</sub><br><br>
	    
	    Since the two equations are known to be equivalent, we known that the ∆x<sub>1</sub> of displacement and ∆x<sub>2</sub> of slope are not the same, as if we were to cancel out the ∆x of the right side by multiplying it by both sides, we would find that ∆x² / ∆t is equal to ∆y, which is total nonsense. The key to understanding how this statement is true (and how the ∆x is referring to two things simultaneously) is to realize that both equations are stating the same ratio, just in terms of different graphs.<br>

	    The equations are both output/input, and so they produce velocity. If the graphs were from the standpoint of velocity, then they would produce acceleration (see the "Important Note").

	    A signifier that indicates that an object is moving with an acceleration that is constant. E.g., in calculus terms, the object has a position represented by an equation with an exponent no higher than two (a quadratic) in its time graph. U.A.M. allows the physicist to use 5 special equations not allowed otherwise:<br><br>
	    
	    1. Velocity Final is equal to velocity initial plus the acceleration multiplied by the change in time:<br>
	    <strong>V<sub>F</sub> = V<sub>i</sub> + (a × ∆t).<br><br></strong>
      2. Displacement is equal to velocity initial multiplied by the change in time, plus 1/2 multiplied by acceleration and the change in time squared:<br>
	    <strong>∆x = (V<sub>i</sub> × ∆t) + (1/2 × a × ∆t²)<br><br></strong>
      3. Velocity final squared is equal to velocity initial squared plus two multiplied by the acceleration and the displacement:<br>
	    <strong>V<sub>F</sub>² = V<sub>i</sub>² + (2 × a × ∆x)<br><br></strong>
      4. The change in position is equal to one half times the quantity of velocity final plus velocity initial:<br>
	    <strong>∆x = (1/2) × (V<sub>F</sub> + V<sub>i</sub>) × ∆t</strong><br><br>
	    <strong>V<sub>F</sub></strong> = Velocity final<br>
	    <strong>V<sub>i</sub></strong> = Velocity initial<br>
	    <strong>a</strong> = Acceleration<br>
	    <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in time<br>
	    <strong>∆x</strong> = Displacement (or change in position)<br>
	    <strong>YOU CAN CHANGE DISPLACEMENT TO BE CHANGE IN Y IF YOU NEED TO, SUCH AS IN FREE FALL EQUATIONS.</strong><br><br>
	    Additionally, there are some lame 'alternate' versions of these equations that are useful for deriving and integrating the equations:<br>
	    v = v<sub>0</sub> + at<br>
	    x = x<sub>0</sub> + v<sub>0</sub>t + (1/2) × at²<br>
	    v² = v<sub>0</sub>² + 2a(x - x<sub>0</sub>)<br>
	    x = x<sub>0</sub> + (1/2) × (v + v<sub>0</sub>) × t<br>

Everyone has hundreds of melodies memorized, so finding one that would match the rhythm and meter of the equation (and there is meter) is not too terribly difficult.

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 12.</font></strong> Acceleration refers to the change in meters per seconds <em>per second</em>, When a ball is rolling on an incline, it will start at 0 m/s in velocity and after 1 second get to 2 m/s, and with each passing second the velocity increases by 2 m/s. Finding the position for those times is just as simple as using the second U.A.M. equation, which in this case leaves you with each change in position equaling the change in time squared.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 13.</font></strong> Order of Magnitude estimates are the most simple estimates possible, with only one significant figure. If the 'order' of magnitude itself is needed, then round to have only tohe power of ten, adding one if rounding up.<em><a href="https://www.nagwa.com/en/videos/216165264935/">External Link</a></em>.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <font color="blue"><strong>Esoteric U.A.M. Problem:</strong></font><br>
	    A use of the U.A.M. equations that is not immediately apparent:<br><br> <em>Two trains, each having a speed of 30 km/h, are headed at each other on the same straight track. A bird that can fly 60 km/h flies off the front of one train when they are 60 km apart and heads directly for the other train. On reaching the other train, the (crazy) bird flies directly back to the first train, and so forth. What is the total distance the bird travels before the trains collide?</em><br><br>
	    
	    This question has several traits that force the physicist to utilize critical thinking skills instead of plugging in numbers into formulas mindlessly, which one may get in the habit of if asked too many uninspired questions. <br><br>
	    For one, velocity cannot replace speed in most circumstances due to the inherent differences of velocity being straight-line difference and speed being the total distance traveled, but there is one exception: If the object (or objects, in this case) travel in a straight-line, which is to say in one dimension, then the speed is equal to the velocity and they are interchangeable.<br><br>
	    The specific parameters of the problem make it easier to solve: image the trains as being simple objects with directionless speed (as stated in the problem), for example. From the perspective of the conductor of the first train, the second train is going 60 kilometers per hour. We can replace the entire two train scenario (which has perfect symmetry and identical U.A.M. variables) and replace it with a single moving object - the trains are individually moving 30 km/hr towards eachother at a starting distance of 60 km from eachother - this is equal to a single train moving at 60 km/hr toward a brick wall 60 km away. Mathematically, these conclusions can be derived as follows:<br><br>
	    
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = Speed<sub>1</sub> + Speed<sub>2</sub><br>
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = 30 km/hr + 30 km/hr<br>
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = 60 km/hr
	    
	    <br><br>
	    Thus, in this question, V<sub>iT</sub> and V<sub>FT</sub> are in reference to the single moving train, are all equal to 60 km/hr. Additionally, the change in x has been changed to 60 km, and considering the doubled speed of the single train, this works out perfectly with the original scenario. Since there are three known variables, we can find the other two.<br>
	    <br>For this question only, it seems more logical to remain in km/hr instead of converting into m/s as is the usual.<br><br>
	    We will first try to get the acceleration out of the train's U.A.M. equations - each equation has acceleration, so we need it to get to what we really want - the change in time.<br><br>
	    V<sub>F1</sub>² = V<sub>i1</sub>² + 2 × a × ∆x<br>
	    (60 km/hr)² = (60 km/hr)² + 2 × a × 60 km.<br>
	    0 = 2 × a × 60 km.<br>
	    a = 0<br><br>
	    This simplifies things significantly. Thus, for the second equation, which has two parts, both with the change in time, and the second with acceleration as a multiplier, is best suited for this scenario, as it can directly reveal the change in time.<br><br>
	    ∆x = V<sub>i1</sub> × ∆t + (1 / 2) × a × (∆t)²<br>
	    60 km = (60 km/hr) × ∆t<br>
	    ∆t = 1<br><br>
	    
	    This is also very useful. If we were to consider the flying bird, we would find that it is flying at the same speed as the train and would thus go 60 km/hr for one hour before crashing into the wall, which is clearly equal to 1 hours worth of flight and thus 60 km of flight distance.
	    <br> Utilizing vector addition (rule 18) would not work, because the directions would cause the train velocities to cancel out.

	    - The only force acting on it is the Force of Gravity.<br>
	    - It is not touching any other objects.<br>
	    - There is no air resistance (the object is falling in a vacuum).

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 15.</font></strong> <strong>a<sub>y</sub> is the acceleration in the y direction</strong> (for free fall on planet earth) is -9.81 m/s², or -g. Thus, free fall is a U.A.M. through the constant acceleration.<br><br>

	    <br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 17.</font></strong> Sometimes, when you are dealing with an object that changes direction, splitting your calculations into two is necessary in order to find information that serves the equation as a whole: For example, if you were to take a ball and throw it up in the air, catching it in the same y-value that you threw it, the change in position would be 0, making it impossible to find the change in time using the the entirety of the event. Thus, one has to divide the movement of the object along the critical point, with the period of the ball moving upward and then moving down being separately used in calculations. Then, values can be combined to reflect the full event (the change in time, if the ball lands in the same place where it was thrown, would be the change in time of either half of the event doubled, due to symmetry. If the ball lands somewhere elsewhere then it was thrown, then the time for each half would have to be calculated and then added together).<br><br><br>
	    
	    
	    <font color="blue"><strong>Common Mistakes in Free Fall:</strong></font><br>
	    -When you throw a ball upward, it will not have a positive acceleration. Having such would make it shoot upward like a rocket. Gravity is a positive constant, but the acceleration in the y direction during free fall is -9.81 m/s² for any object, whether moving upward or downward.<br><br>
	    -Objects thrown upward do not have an initial velocity of 0 - they already have a positive velocity before being thrown due to whatever is throwing them. An initial velocity of zero in the y direction will not cause an object to move upward - it must be positive. <br>
	   <br>-The force with which an object is thrown will not effect the acceleration. Regardless of whether a ball is dropped or thrown downward, the acceleration in the y direction will be -9.81 m/s², and only the position and velocity will change to reflect this force.

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 18.</font></strong> Introductory Tip-to-Tail Vector Addition:<br>
	    Vector addition is not simply adding the magnitude of the vectors together, but using the pythagorean theorem to find the line that connects the given vectors when they are placed tail-to-tip. If the vectors are in perfect cardinal direction, as is the example below, then of course pythagorean theorem can be quickly applied. Otherwise, using vector decomposition (Rule 20) is the easiest way to create a right triangle for use in the pythagorean theorem, unless you want to use the Law of Cosines.<br>
	    Here are two vectors utilizing the vector symbols:<br><br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> = 49 (mm/s) North<br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span> = 42 (mm/s) East <br>

	    In order to solve for the resultant vector, some geometry would need to be performed:<br>
	    a² + b² = c²<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>R</strong></span>² = <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>² + <span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span>²<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>R</strong></span> = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;"><span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>² + <span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span>²</span></span><br>
	    = 65 mm/s.<br><br>
	    Since a vector has direction, we need to find it trigonometrically:<br>
	    tanθ = (O / A) = (<span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span> / <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span>) = (42 / 49)<br>
	    θ = tan⁻¹(42/49) = 40.601° = East of North (see rule 19).<br>
	    Thus, the object is moving at a resultant vector of 65 mm/s East of North.<br><br>
	    Can you be?

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 20.</font></strong> Complex vector problems oftentimes entail vector decomposition, where one may have to use trigonometry in order to find the sides of the vector triangle. Take this North of East vector for example:<br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> = 90.0 cm @ 32° N of E.<br>

	    The vector <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> has two component vectors, <span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>x</sub></strong></span> and <span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>y</sub></strong></span>.
	    <br><br>sinθ = (O / H) = (<span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>y</sub></strong></span> / <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>)<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>y</sub></strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>sinθ = 90sin(32) = 47.693 ≈ 48cm.<br><br>
	    
	    cosθ = (A / H) = (<span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>x</sub></strong></span> / <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>)<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>d<sub>x</sub></strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>cosθ = 90cos(32) = 76.324 ≈ 76cm.<br><br>
	    Decomposing a vector is also called "breaking" or "resolving" the vector. The information of the original vector can be derived from the component vectors as well, using inverse tangent and the pythagorean theorem.

	    Unit vectors are vectors with a magnitude of 1 unit in an absolute direction, without any decomposable angle. They are written differently than normal vectors, with a roof symbol on top rather than an arrow:<br><br>
	    <strong>i&#x302;</strong> = <strong>x&#x302;</strong> = 1 unit in the x direction.<br>
	    <strong>j&#x302;</strong> = <strong>y&#x302;</strong> = 1 unit in the y direction.<br>
	    <strong>k&#x302;</strong> = <strong>z&#x302;</strong> = 1 unit in the z direction.<br><br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>v<sub>ix</sub></strong></span> ≈ [31.7i&#x302; + 14.8j&#x302;] m/s ≈ 35.0 m/s @ 25.0° above horizontal.<br>
	    This way of writing is simply the pre-decomposed way of writing a vector.<br>
	    <br><br>If you have to go from an already decomposed roof form to the exact same form as an answer, it is easy as hell:<br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> = [2.0<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 2.0<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span> = [1.0<strong>i&#x302;</strong> - 3.0<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m<br><span class="vecteur"><strong>C</strong></span> = [4.0<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 4.0<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m<br><br><span class="vecteur"><strong>R</strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>A</strong></span> + <span class="vecteur"><strong>B</strong></span> + <span class="vecteur"><strong>C</strong></span> = [7.0i&#x302; + 3.0j&#x302;]m<br><br>
	    Note that given the component vectors, reconstruction of a direction for the whole vector is possible (obviously), though unless the angle is a perfect 45°, you will only get a general idea of where it is pointing, since 25° North of East is the same as 65° East of North.
	    
	    <br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">P. Rule 23.</font></strong> When the questions asks to find the distance between two vectors, you can use a simple mechanic:<br> Create your own vector that has its tail on the tip of the first vector and its tip on the tip of the second vector, call it ∆<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span>.<br><br>
	    <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong></span> + ∆<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong></span><br>
	    
	    ∆<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong></span>
	    <br><br>
	    You do not have to move any of the given vectors, you can simply create one that serves the middle an already connected vector would have served in its place. Then, find the displacement (length) of that vector by using the strategies taught in rules 19 and 20. The vectors may look similar to this:<br><br>

	    From this point, you can either find the answer in terms of unit vectors or in terms of magnitude in direction. Of course, unit vectors will always be faster and simpler. Here is an example problem carried out to fruition using unit vectors:<br>
	    <p><span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong></span> = 15.0m @ 55.0° <strong>E</strong> of <strong>N</strong><br><span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong></span> = 25.0m @ 45.0° <strong>N</strong> of <strong>E</strong></p>

THE UNIT VECTOR DECOMPOSITION OF THE <strong>FIRST</strong> VECTOR:
<p><span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong></span> = [r<sub>1</sub>sinθ<sub>1</sub><strong>i&#x302;</strong> + r<sub>1</sub>cosθ<sub>1</sub><strong>j&#x302;</strong>] <br>= [(15)sin(55)<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + (15)cos(55)<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m <br>= [12.2872<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 8.60365<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m</p>
THE UNIT VECTOR DECOMPOSITION OF THE <strong>SECOND</strong> VECTOR:
<p><span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong></span> = [r<sub>2</sub>cosθ<sub>2</sub><strong>i&#x302;</strong> + r<sub>2</sub>sinθ<sub>2</sub><strong>j&#x302;</strong>] <br>= [(25)cos(45)<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + (25)sin(45)<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m <br>= [17.6777<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 17.6777<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m</p>


<p>Δ<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong></span> − <span class="vecteur"><strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong></span> = [12.2872<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 8.60365<strong>j&#x302;</strong>] − [17.6777<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 17.6777<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]<br>
= Δ<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> = [5.39040<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 9.07405<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m<br><br>

Because change in r is also change in position, this vector is also the displacement between the two original vectors: <br>
Δ<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> ≈ [5.39<strong>i&#x302;</strong> + 9.07<strong>j&#x302;</strong>]m</p>

Because the question asked for the distance, we need to find the magnitude of the displacement using that specific equation; see the definition of displacement in section I.III for a better understanding of what is being done here.

<p>|Δ<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span>| = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">(5.39040)² + (9.07405)²</span></span></p>
<p>|Δ<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span>| = 10.5544 ≈ 10.6m</p>

	    <article>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 25.</font></strong> <strong>Projectile Motion</strong> - A specialization of Free Fall in which the object is moving in multiple dimensions. Thus, this movement has all of the properties of free fall in place:<br>
	    - The only force acting on it is the Force of Gravity.<br>
	    - It is not touching any other objects.<br>
	    - There is no air resistance (the object is falling in a vacuum).<br>
	    - The object has Uniformly Accelerated Motion, and thus can have all of the U.A.M. equations applied.
	    <br><br>
	    When solving a problem like this, you would need to separate your known variables in the x and y directions. The equations that describe the motions of an object in projectile motion are different in the x direction and the y direction. Various things placed in their appropriate columns include:
	    <br><br>
	    X-direction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;┃&nbsp;Y-Direction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

	    In projectile motion, the object will not accelerate to the left or to the right, it will have a constant velocity only. The localized gravity here on Earth makes it only give the y direction of a falling object acceleration.<br><br> If you were to drop an object straight downward, the constant velocity would be zero as it would not move in the x or y direction whatsoever. It would also not be in projectile motion, as it is only moving in one dimension.<br> If the object were to be thrown however, the object would have a non-zero constant velocity and would be in projectile motion.<br><br><br>

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 26.</font></strong> - <strong>Differing equations</strong> for free fall in the X-direction and Y-directions:<br>
	    <h3>X-DIRECTION:</h3>
	    Since the acceleration for projectile motion in the x-direction is always zero, and every U.A.M. equation has acceleration, after plugging in zero for acceleration for each one we are left with only two equations:<br><br>1. <strong>V<sub>F</sub> = V<sub>i</sub></strong><br>
	    The first equation simplifies the velocity of x in projectile motion to a single variable, V<sub>x</sub>, which we already intuitively knew.<br><br>
	    
	    <strong>2. ∆x = V<sub>i</sub> × ∆t</strong><br><br>
	    Substituting in V<sub>x</sub>, as discovered in the first equation, gives us the following:<br><br>
	    <strong>∆x = V<sub>x</sub> × ∆t</strong><br><br>
	    Upon further inspection, one should be able to identify this equation as merely being the standard velocity equation:
	    V<sub>x</sub> = (∆x / ∆t)<br><br>
	    Thus, the velocity equation itself must be the one used when calculating movement in the x direction during projectile motion. Since there are only 3 variables, you would need to know 2 variables to discover the other 1.<br>
	    <h3>Y-DIRECTION:</h3>
	    For the y direction, the equations are the same as they have always been - all four U.A.M. equations are in play with acceleration as -9.81 m/s², and you need three variables to find the other two. This simplifies the process.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 27.</font></strong> The only U.A.M. variable that is a scalar is change in time (∆t). If you solve for the change in time in the y or x direction, you can use it for the other direction. This is because ∆t is independent of direction as a scalar.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 28.</font></strong> When you need to find the final velocity of an object in projectile motion, you need to find the velocity in the y direction and the velocity in the x direction. Then, you must realize that since you have the x and y components of an objects movement, that you have the decomposed vector and now need to find the vector itself, the hypotenuse of the triangle through the pythagorean theorem.<br><br>NEVER FORGET to find the direction at the end - you just have to do the sin inverse (or cosine inverse depending on which theta you need, though the theta should always be on the tail of the vector/hypotenuse) using the x and y decomposed vectors. This will give you the angle that, if you don't have any particular directions to work off at the beginning, can just be said to 'in front of the negative y-axis' if the object is moving rightward and downward, changing this as needed. <br>Remember that angles also must follow sig. fig. rules no matter what. <br>Vectors always require direction in addition to magnitude, a + or - will not do.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 29.</font></strong> As an object falls, the magnitude of the velocity increases and the direction of the velocity points farther and farther down. The velocity vector arrows increase in length as the object falls, because the magnitude of the object's velocity keeps increasing.<br><br>

	    <strong><font color="red">P.

	    While the force of gravity acts straight down on the object based on its center of mass, the force of drag acts opposite to the direction of the velocity of the object:

Courtesy of <a href="https://www.flippingphysics.com/the-euler-method.html">Flipping Physics</a>.</em></span><br><br>The force of drag is (generally - this will be discussed more later) defined by the following equation:<br><br><strong>F<sub>drag</sub> = (1/2) × ρ × V² × D × A</strong><br><br> <strong>ρ</strong> (rho) = Density of the medium<br><strong>V</strong> = Velocity of the object<br><strong>D</strong> = Drag Coefficient<br><strong>A</strong> = Cross Sectional Area<br><br><strong>A</strong>: The cross sectional area of the object is the area of the object normal to the direction of it's travel. E.g., when the object is moving directly towards you, what object do you see?<br>Take the object to be a ball, for the sake of discussion. <br><br><strong>A<sub>circle</sub> = πr²</strong><br> Additionally, let's assume that the radius and mass of the ball are 0.031835 meters and 0.14529 kg, respectively, and that the velocity V<sub>ix</sub> in the first 1/100th of a second is 4.469444 m/s. <br><br>
	    <strong>D</strong>: The drag coefficient is a number which aerodynamicists use to model all of the complex dependencies of drag on shape, inclination, and some flow conditions. Essentially, it the number determined through experiment that helps determine an object's drag. Thus, the coefficient will change depending on the shape of the object, the type of fluid flow around the object, and the object's speed.<br>
	    The drag coefficient for a smooth sphere is 0.5, conveniently.<br><br>
	    
	    <strong>ρ</strong>: The medium in which the object is traveling is of course air, and the density of air can fluctuate due to temperature and pressure differences. The generalized air density we will use is 1.275 kg/m³. <br><br>
	    <strong>V</strong>: Since we know we will be working with the force in the x-direction, we can use V<sub>i</sub> and V<sub>F</sub> interchangeably with V<sub>T</sub>. As the velocity of the object changes, the drag coefficient will change with it, changing the net force (as shown in the free body diagram) of the ball, and changing the ball's acceleration. Summarized, <br><br> 
	    <strong>∆V → ∆F<sub>net</sub> → ∆a.</strong><br>
	    &thinsp;&thinsp;↑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;&hairsp;↓<br>
	    &thinsp;&thinsp;┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛<br><br>
	    Clearly, the acceleration is not constant throughout this interaction, and so the object would not be in U.A.M.<br>However, the mathematician <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> devised a trick to emulate U.A.M. by splitting the motion of the object into many short-lasting parts, such as 1/100th of a second, under which the acceleration is approximately constant. This is similar to the concept of Riemann sums being used to find the area under the curves, with the more subdivisions, the more accuracy. Let us do some preliminary work to find the net force in the x-direction before utilizing Euler's method:<br>
	    <h3 style="font-size:135%;">&Sigma;&hairsp;F<sub>x</sub> = -F<sub>drag x</sub> = m × a<sub>x</sub><br>a<sub>x</sub> = -((1/2) × ρ<sub>air</sub> × (V<sub>ix</sub>)² × D × A)<br>a<sub>x</sub> = -(ρ<sub>air</sub> × (V<sub>ix</sub>)² × D × (πr²)) / 2m<br>a<sub>x</sub> = -(1.275 × (4.4694)² × 0.5 × (π × (0.031835)²))&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;2 × (0.14529)<br>a<sub>x</sub> = -0.13953 m/s²
	    <br>
	    </h3>
	    There is only one force in the x-direction, the drag, which is of course going in the opposite direction of the object in the x-direction and so is negative. This is the net force of the ball, and by <u>Newton's Second Law of Motion</u> (see Rule [[[[[[[[[), we know that the net force is equal to the mass of the ball times the acceleration in the x-direction. Continuing onward, we can substitute in the drag equation to be equal to mass times acceleration. From there, the algebra is simple, and you just need to plug in all of your variables to find the answer.<br><br>
	    As a result, we have found the acceleration in the x-direction, which DOES NOT EXIST in projectile motion. Since you now know acceleration, Velocity initial, and change in time (1/100 sec), you find 4.6805 m/s as your velocity final. Therefore, compared to the Velocity intitial of this 0.01 second period of 4.4694, the velocity in the x direction (which we took to be constant) has decreased by 1.4 thousandths of a meter per second, accounting for air resistance in our calculations and contrary to what the standard U.A.M. equations for projectile motion would suggest.<br><br>
	    ∆x = x<sub>F</sub> - x<sub>i</sub> = V<sub>ix</sub> × ∆t + (1/2) × a<sub>x</sub> × (∆t)²<br>x<sub>F</sub> = x<sub>i</sub> + V<sub>ix</sub> × ∆t + (1/2) × a<sub>x</sub> × (∆t)²<br>
	    x = (0)+(4.4694) × (0.01) + (1/2) × (-0.13953) × (0.01)²<br>
	    = 0.04469 meters<br><br>

	    <strong><font color="red">P. Rule 31.</font></strong> Anything U.A.M. variable that is a vector can be decomposed to find its x and y-direction component vectors. This is most useful when you need to find the movement of an object in both directions during projectile motion. For example, if an object were to be launched with an initial speed of 3.25 m/s at an angle of 61.7°, you can easily find the initial velocity in the x-direction and y-direction by using the decomposition tricks of Rule 20.<br><br><br>
