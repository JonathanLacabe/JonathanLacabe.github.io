"<strong>Capacitance</strong>", indeed, is the property that enables a capacitor to do so, see Rule [[[+2. A capacitor's capacitance relies solely on the capacitor's physical characteristics, its shape and the material (if any) used to separate the plates.

        </strong> If not otherwise stated, all Parallel Plates have <strong>charges of equal magnitude</strong> and <strong>opposite signs</strong>.<br><br>

        The Parallel Plate is the most basic example of a capacitor - two conductors a distance away from eachother, creating electric fields pointing towards the negative plate. Anywhere in the field, there will electric potential energy stored (zero at the negative plate, and maximum at the positive plate). See Rule [[[ for more information.</div><br><br><br>

      <strong>C</strong> = Capacitance. The measure of how much charge must be given to a <em>capacitor</em> (an object that stores electric potential energy - see definition) to produce a certain potential difference. Always Positive.<br>
      
      <strong>Q</strong> = The <u>magnitude</u> of the charge stored on either plate. Always Positive.<br>
      
      <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between the two plates. Always Positive.

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Capacitance is the measure of how much charge must be given to a <em>capacitor</em> (an object that stores electric potential energy - see definition) to produce a certain potential difference. It is a ratio between these two values.<br><br>
      
      Capacitance is always a positive value, and thus so are charge and voltage. None of that "two negatives cancelling out" nonsense either, only the magnitude of the charge is being considered, so it literally has to be a positive number (and thus voltage as well).<br><br>
      
      The above equation functions for ALL forms of capacitance, for any object that is capable of storing and maintaining an electric potential difference. However, the individual <em>types</em> of capacitors possess their own type-specific equations that are useful in their specific circumstances. For example, see Rule [[[+1 for the equation of Parallel Plates, the simplest and most common type of capacitor.<!--and that which is used in circuitry diagrams.-->

      <strong>A</strong> = The total surface area of either plate (imagined to be infinitely thin).<br>
      
      <strong>d</strong> = The distance between the two plates. This is also the distance upon which the electric potential difference of the general equation is taken.
      
      <br><br><br>
      
      
      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Parallel Plate Capacitors are the most common form of capacitor in Physics, and are amongst spherical and cylindrical capacitors as the only capacitor forms worth knowing in baby freshman Physics (alongside some additional features and tricks - see dielectrics in Rule [[[ & Rule [[[).<br><br>

The capacitance of a parallel plate measures how much charge must be given to the plates to produce a certain potential difference between them. The given equation was found by substituting in an equation specific to the characteristics of the parallel plates (the electric field at the surface of a conductor - Rule 196) into the uniform voltage equation of Rule 200, and then substituting in that entire mess into the generalized capacitance equation of Rule 211.<br><br>
      
      A parallel plate capacitor functions by separating the charge onto the two plates, the very act of which is performing work to keep them in place (since the plates are attracted toward eachother) and putting electric potential energy into the system.<br><br>
      
      The <em>net</em> charge on a capacitor, being composed of a negative and positive plate of equal charge magnitudes, will be zero. However, not to worry: all that is necessary for any capacitance-related calculations is the q of a single plate.<br><br>

Note that through usage of the permittivity of free space constant,  all parallel plate capacitors will be considered as being within a vacuum (for reasons explained in Rule 164). This has important implications for things like the dielectric, explained in Rule [[[.

        </strong> A <strong>Charged Capacitor</strong> is one in which charge flow is enabled (and thus has an extant electric potential difference), allowing for all properties of capacitance to be applied. This is the state that <u>every</u> problem relating to capacitance will place the capacitor in, and it should always be assumed for a given capacitor.<br><br>
      
      An <strong>Uncharged Capacitor</strong> (also known by idiots as a "<strong>Discharged Capacitor</strong>") has <strong><em>no</em></strong> charge whatsoever. For parallel plates, this means that neither plate will have charge. Thus, there will be no electric potential/potential energy nor any electric field between the plates. In such a capacitor, the electric potential difference between the plates is zero.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Full Dielectric Analysis.</strong><br><br>
        <!--we're getting to bottom of this dielectric business, and won't stop until the bottom of the ocean is drained and all time has ceased-->
        
        A dielectric is an insulating material placed between the plates of a capacitor, helping to physically separate the two plates and increase the capacitance through a process known as <strong>polarization</strong> (the very same that was described in Rule 168, that makes balloons stick on walls).<br><br>
        
        When a dielectric is placed within the electric field between the plates, the electric field arranges the molecules in the dielectric according to the law of charges. <br><br>
        
        The positive sides of the molecules in the dielectric material are attracted to the negative plate of the capacitor, while the negative sides of the molecules are attracted to the positive plate.<br><br>
        
        As a result, the dielectric becomes <u>polarized</u>, with the arranged molecules forming what is known as an <strong>induced field</strong> opposite the direction of the original electric field.<br><br>
        
        As a result of the induced field being opposite in direction of the original, the net electric field of a capacitor with a dielectric is <em>smaller</em> than the original electric field:<br><br>
        
        <strong>E = E<sub>original</sub> - E<sub>induced</sub></strong><br><br>
        
        Thus, a smaller electric field will lead to a lower electric potential difference (because of the uniform equation of Rule 200).<br><br>
        
        If the capacitor is not part of a circuit (see Rule [[[), then the dielectric will <u>not</u> change the charge on the capacitor. Thus, <strong>capacitance will actually increase</strong> when there is a dielectric in place, since the electric potential difference is in the denominator of the capacitance equation (see Rule 211).<br><br>
        
        If the capacitor IS part of a circuit however, then its a totally different story.<br><br> 
        <!--[[[fix this nonsense when the time comes will a little expalantion bleeding into a "for more information" reference.-->
        
        Mathematically, the effect of the dielectric is represented using its own constant (which can be then used to create a new version of the capacitance equation), described in detail in Rule [[[+1.</div><br><br>
