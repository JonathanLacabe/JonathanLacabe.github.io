          Electric potential energy works much the same as gravitational potential energy. As an object has greater gravitational potential energy the farther away it is from the source of its atraction, two oppositely charged objects, attracted to one another, will have greater <em>electric</em> potential energy the farther they are from one another. Their attraction inherently transforms this potential energy into kinetic energy as they attract, a result of the Conservation of Mechanical Energy.<br><br>

            Obversely, two charged objects that repel will have their greatest potential energy when they are closest, increasing in kinetic energy as they farthern from one another.<br><br>
            
            This is the essence of electric potential energy: the potential for two charged objects to attract or repel from one another, to <em>move</em> as a result of the electric force produced by their interacting electric fields.<br><br>
            
            <!--Effectively,--><strong>The electric field vector points from higher potential toward lower potential</strong>.

        $$\Delta U_e = -q \int_{i}^{f} E \cos\theta \, dr$$
        <br>
        <strong>∆U<sub>e</sub></strong> = The change in electric potential energy. It does <u>not</u> depend on the path taken between point A and point B - rather, all that is required is the displacement itself. Measured in Joules.<br><br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the charge/charged particle of the particular point being measured.<br><br>
        
        <strong>i</strong> = A generic starting point of a path taken in an electric field.<br><br>

        <strong>E</strong> = The magnitude of the electric field at a particular point.<br><br>
        
        <strong>θ</strong> = The angle between the directions of the electric field and the direction of the infinitesimally small displacement dr. When the charge is moving in the direction opposite that of the electric field, the angle will be 180°, and the negative of the resulting cosine will cancel out with the one outside the integral.<br><br>
        
        <strong>d<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span></strong> = The infinitesimally small displacement of the charge, essentially its position.<br><br><br><br>
        
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

        
        Finding an equation to express electric potential energy is no difficult task at all. As a conservative force, the electric force can have all of the existing equations for potential energy and work (see Rule 100) applied:<br><br>

        <strong>F<sub>E</sub> = -(dU<sub>e</sub> / dr)</strong><br><br>
        
        E.g., the electric force equals the negative of the derivative of the "electric potential energy" with respect to position (the infinitesimally small change in position dr).<br><br>
        
        By simplifying this equation slightly, as in moving variables around, integrating both sides, and substituting in values for electric force, a new and improved Change in Electric Potential equation can be developed, seen above.<br><br>    
        
        The potential energy of a positive charge increases as it moves opposite the direction of the electric field, while the potential energy of the negative charge will decrease as it moves opposite the direction of the field. E.g., change in potential energy will be positive for a positive charge, and negative for a negative charge.</div><br><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Electric Potential</strong>: SCALAR (though an attribute of a vector Electric Field).<br><br>

<u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Volts, e.g. Joules / Coulombs. The symbol for the volts unit, hilariously, is the same as the symbol for electric potential: <em><strong>V</strong></em>.<br><br><br>
	  

<u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br> 

<strong>V = (U<sub>e</sub> / q)</strong><br><br>

<strong>V</strong> = Electric Potential, the measure of electric potential energy experienced per unit charge in an electric field. Measured in Volts.<br>
<strong>U<sub>e</sub></strong> = The magnitude Electric Potential Energy, explained in detail in Rule 198 and in the introduction directly above. Note that this refers to the p.e. of a single point.<br>
<strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the charge/charged particle of the particular point being measured.

<br><br><br>


<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

The Electric Potential is a measure of the electric potential energy experienced per unit charge in an electric field. V and ΔU are indeed different - they have the same relationship as electric field and electric force. The electric potential energy is what <em>creates</em> the electric potential. <!--I could probably write something more substantive here, but it will do for now.--><br><br>

Since Electric Potential is a scalar value, the net electric potential at a particular point is found by summing each electric potential values (from each electric field) at that point.<br><br>

In the same manner in which an electric field is defined by the force experienced by a small, positive test charge (see Subsection XIII.I), the electric potential is defined by the <em>energy</em> experienced by a small, positive test charge.<br><br>

Of considerable importance and inherent relation to electric potential is <em>Electric Potential Difference</em>, aka, voltage. For more information, see Rule 200.</div><br><br><br>

        $$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U_e}{q}$$

        <strong>∆V</strong> = The Electric Potential Difference, the difference between the electric potentials of two points in an electric fields. Measured in Volts.<br><br>
        
        <strong>∆U<sub>e</sub></strong> = The change in electric potential energy. It does <u>not</u> depend on the path taken between point A and point B - rather, all that is required is the displacement itself. Measured in Joules.<br><br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the charge/charged particle of the particular point being measured.<br><br>
        
        <strong>i</strong> = A generic "starting" point in the electric field for measuring the electric potential difference.<br><br>

        <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>E</strong></span></strong> = The electric field at a particular point, the one that is generating the electric potential. When constant, it can be taken out of the integral, and the equation can resolve to <strong>∆V = -Ed</strong>.<br><br>
        
        <strong>d<span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span></strong> = The infinitesimally small displacement of the charge, essentially its position.<br><br><br><br>
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

        The <em>change</em> in electric potential, derived from the Electric Potential described in Rule 199, is arguably more important and used than electric potential by itself.<br><br>
        
        Represented by <strong>∆V</strong>, the Electric Potential Difference (also known as <strong>Voltage</strong>) is the difference in the electric potential between two points: ∆V = V<sub>f</sub> - V<sub>i</sub>.<br><br>
        
        Equations representing ∆V, slightly reworked from those of Rule 199 & Rule 198, are given above. If V<sub>i</sub> = 0, then these equations are merely calculating the electric potential at point f. When the electric field is uniform, then it can be taken out of the integral, and the equation can resolve to <strong>∆V = -Ed</strong>.<br><br>
        
        Inherently, a charge does not need to move from one point to another in order for the difference to exist; ∆V's existence is only dependent on the electric field itself.

        </strong> <strong>Equipotential Surfaces/Lines</strong>:<br><br>

        An equipotential surface or line is one in which the electric potential is the same at every point along it. These lines form from (and have their shapes determined by) an electric field. Of course, this means that if the electric field is resulting from a negative charge, then each electric potential value along the equipotential line will be negative. If resulting from a positive charge, then each value will be positive. Simple as.<br><br>
        
        Equipotential Lines, also known as <strong>isolines</strong>, are always perpendicular to the electric field - thus, the electric field will have no components along the equipotential line.<br><br>
        
        In a uniform electric field, an equipotential line will be an infinite straight line. In an electric field around a charged particle, the equipotential lines will be circles concentric to the particle.<br><br>
        
        The electric potential difference between any point on one equipotential line to any point along another equipotential line will be the same.<br><br>
        
        When moving a charge along an equipotential line, the work required to do so is zero (since the electric potential difference will be zero - see Rule 205).</div><br><br>

          As occurred when the revelation of the Charge-Flux Law resulted in multitudes of new electric field equations being discovered (see Subsection XIV.III), reflecting all manners of electrical shapes and phenomena (dipoles, shells, rods, etc.), all derived from the same basic fundamental equations (namely the charge density equations and the Charge-Flux law itself), the same effectively occurs for Electric Potential in the subsection below.<br><br>

          In this section, there can be found the multitudes of equations that describe the electric potential of different shapes and assortments/distributions, from electric dipoles to continuous charge distributions and beyond.<br><br>

      <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>:

      In circumstances in which you are calculating the Electric Potential generated by a single point charge (which, since Electric Potential is a scalar, just means ignoring the electric fields of any other variables in the equation (if any)), there is a single equation that you can use that works regardless of whether the charge is negative or positive (though you will have to factor this into the sign of q):<br><br>
      
      Of course, this equation (given above) is effectively assigning zero electric potential to any points infinitely far away.<br><br>

        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Akin to calculating the center of mass of a system, finding the net electric potential of a system of particles is lightwork.

        The potential resulting from each charge is effectively calculated individually, summed thereafter. This sum is an <strong>algebraic sum</strong> (or <strong>scalar sum</strong>), not a <em>vector sum</em> like the sum used to calculate the electric field resulting from a group of charged particles.<br><br>
        
        Remember that the distance from the point of the test charge (necessary for finding the strength of the electric potential at said point) is found for each particle individually.</div><br><br>

          If the charged object moves through an electric potential difference ∆V without an applied force acting on it (moving purely through electric attraction), then only conservative forces are acting upon it. Applying and simplifying the conservation of mechanical energy equation gives the following equation for change in kinetic energy:<br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K = -q × ∆V</strong><br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K</strong> = Change in Electric Kinetic Energy.<br><br>
          <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the object, which is irrelevant to the positioning/movement of the object.<br><br>
          <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br><br><br><br>
          
          
          
          If, instead, an external/applied force is acting on the charged object, creating nonconservative work, then the change in kinetic energy is as follows:<br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K = (-q × ∆V) + W<sub>nonc</sub></strong><br><br><br>
          
          <strong>∆K</strong> = Change in Electric Kinetic Energy.<br><br>
          
          <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the object, which is irrelevant to the positioning/movement of the object.<br><br>
          
          <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br>
          
          <strong>W<sub>nonc</sub></strong> = The work produced by the external, nonconservative force, breaking the conservation of mechanical energy.<br><br><br>
          
          
          A special case can emerge in which ∆K equals to zero. Then, and only then, can W<sub>nonc</sub> be isolated in a very simple manner, just moving variables to the other side. For more details, see Rule 205.</div><br><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Work in moving a Charged Object</strong>: SCALAR.<br><br>
        
        <u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Joules.<br><br><br>
        
        <u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>
        
        <strong>W<sub>nonc</sub> = q × ∆V</strong><br><br><br>
        
        <strong>W<sub>nonc</sub></strong> = The work produced by the external, nonconservative force, breaking the conservation of mechanical energy.<br><br>
        
        <strong>q</strong> = The magnitude of the electric charge carried by the object, which is irrelevant to the positioning/movement of the object.<br><br>
        
        <strong>∆V</strong> = The electric potential difference between two points in an electric field.<br><br><br>
        
        
        <u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: If a charged object is moved from an initial point to a final point (differing points, obviously) via an external force, then the external force is performing work on the object. Furthermore, this work will change the electric potential energy of the charge.<br><br>
        
        There is an equation that can be used to find this work value in relation to electric potential difference - however, it requires that there be no change in the kinetic energy of the charge. Thus, it mandates the breaking of the conservation of Mechanical Energy. Since an external force is being applied (in order for there to even <em>be</em> work), this was already assumed and isn't much of an issue.<br><br>
        
        Therefore, under these circumstances, work equals the magnitude of the charged object's charge, multiplied by the electric potential difference the charge went through.<br><br>
        
        Note that the given equation is the negative of the work produced by an electric field, which itself can be derived by applying Rule 100 equations for potential energy to the 1st equation found in Rule 200.<!--goated coincidence-->

        </strong> <strong>Electronvolts</strong>:<br><br>

A new unit, more convenient for dealing with work & electric potential/kinetic energy, is the Electronvolt. An electronvolt is defined as the work required to move a single elementary charge e (such as that of an electron or proton) through an electric potential difference ΔV of exactly one volt, and can thus be used to represent very small amounts of energy.<br><br>

<strong>1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J</strong></div><br><br>
