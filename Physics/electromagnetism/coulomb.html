Charge causes matter to experience an electric force (see [[[). Because the terms "negative" and "positive" are used to denote charge, summing charges is very simple when one needs to determine net charge.<br><br>

The character '<strong>q</strong>' is used to denote the net charge on an object.

        </strong> The '<strong>Coulomb</strong>' is the SI unit for Electric Charge. Specifically, it is defined as the "amount of electric charge  transported by a current of one ampere flowing for one second" (see definitions of each new term, they are gone over in more depth later on).<br><br>

By itself, a Coulomb is a huge amount of charge - charged particles like protons and electrons have electric charges many orders of magnitude smaller than a single Coulomb. Two objects, each with one Coulomb of charge, located one meter apart, experience an electric force of roughly nine billion newtons.</div><br><br>

Examples include electrons, photons, and quarks.

        </strong> An <strong>atom</strong>, the smallest unit of matter retaining the chemical properties of its element, is composed of a dense <strong>nucleus</strong> with Protons and Neutrons, and surrounded by orbitals of electrons.

Electrons & Protons are small <u>particles</u> (e.g., specks of mass) that carry an <em>electric charge</em> with a magnitude of ~1.69 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, which is referred to as the <strong>"Elementary Charge"</strong>. Protons are positively charged, while electrons are negatively charged.<br><br>

Electrons are elementary particles, indivisible by nature, while protons are composed of quarks - specifically, two up quarks and one down quark.<br><Br>

The up quark has a charge of +(2/3)e, while the down quark has a charge of -(1/3)e. Thus, the net quark of a proton is +e.<br><br>

The neutron, being composed of one up quark and two down quarks, has a net charge of 0. If this were not the case, the nucleus of an atom would repel <br><br>

The electron, being an elementary particle, just has a net charge of -e.</div><br><br>

	    <strong><a href="#ExcessChargeDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ExcessChargeDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Excess Charge</font></strong>: The state of an object being more negatively or positively charged due to a lack or oversupply of negatively-charged electrons, the movement of which can be facilitated by rubbing objects together (<u>charging by friction</u>). An "excess positive charge" is slang for an electron deficit, while an "excess negative charge" means an oversupply of electrons.

	    <strong>Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel</strong>.<br><br>

Example: Rubbing a balloon against one's hair will cause the electrons to move from the hair to the balloon (a transfer faciliated by rubbing), causing the balloon to stick to the hair. Furthermore, since each hair will become more positively-charged, they will repel one another, causing one's hair to stick up and separate.

        </strong> There is an equation relating net charge and elementary charge (or any quantifiable proportion of elementary charge), useful for determining how many excess charge carriers it would take for a specific net charge to be achieved:<br><br>

<strong>q = n × e</strong><br><br>

<strong>q</strong> = Net charge on an object<br>
<strong>n</strong> = Excess number of charge carriers (protons or electrons or whatever - it just has to be ONE of them).<br>
<strong>e</strong> = Elementary Charge</div><br><br>

            <font color="red">P. Rule <span class="rule-number"></span>.</font>
        </strong> Charge is <strong>quantized</strong>, meaning that it must come in discrete quantities, integer multiples of the elementary charge. This is because the 'net charge' of an object is the product of having more or fewer charged particles, and thus only multiples of the elementary charge are possible (since elementary particles are indivisible).<br><br>

Using the net/elementary charge relation (see Rule 159), one can find that it is impossible for an object to have a net negative charge of 2.00 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs, as such a net force would require 1.25 electrons, violating quantization.</div><br><br>

        </strong> <strong>Coulomb's Law</strong>: VECTOR.<br><br>

<u><strong>Units</strong></u>: Newtons.<br><br><br>


<u><strong>Equation</strong></u>:<br><br>

<strong>F<sub>e</sub> = (k × q<sub>1</sub> × q<sub>2</sub>) / (r²)</strong><br><br>



<strong>F<sub>e</sub></strong> = The magnitude of the electric force that exists between two charged particles.<br>
<strong>k</strong> = The Coulomb constant, equal to 8.99 × 10⁹ (N × m²) / (C²). <br>
<strong>q<sub>1</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 1, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>q<sub>2</sub></strong> = The net charge on object 2, measured in Coulombs.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The distance between the centers of charge of the two objects.

<br><br><br>

<u><strong>Definition</strong></u>: Coulomb's Law enables one to find the magnitude of the Electric Force, the force produced by the Electric Charge inherent to all matter.<br><br>

Note that this equation looks very similar to <!--hella like--> the Universal Law of Gravitation (see Rule 142). Accordingly, k (the Coulomb constant) functions similar to G (the Gravitational constant), being equal to (N × m²) / (a particular composition property of mass)². Clearly, since the Coulomb constant is 20 orders of magnitude stronger than the Gravitational constant, the Electric Force between objects is much more powerful than their Gravitational attraction. F<sub>e</sub> &gt;&gt;&gt; F<sub>g</sub>.<br><br>

If the calculated Electric Force has a <strong>Negative Value</strong>, then it is an <u><em>attractive force</em></u>. If the Electric Force has a <strong>Positive Value</strong>, then it is a <u><em>repulsive force</em></u>. This is quite obvious upon momentary consideration - a negative and a positive charge will always produce a negative, and thus attractive force, which matches the Law of Charges that opposite's attract. Thus also follows for repulsive like charges.

        </strong> <!--I am very happy about this Rule - what you have in textbooks and whatever is the raw information, but the 'in-the-field' knowledge that you can only obtain by doing the problems and thinking shit out rationally by yourself, 'homework rules' as I call it, that is the most important and valuable educational resource that you can have in creating your knowledge tool for relearning content after the fact. You regain that state of mind that, that creative flow specific to that topic.-->

With charges, the fundamental concept to understand in applying Coulomb's Law <!--in any circumstance-->is that in order to derive any useful information (depending on the question, but in general), you must determine the effect of the electric force on the individual point charges. Specifically, you must be able to determine the direction the charges will move in as a result of the force.<br><br>

Coulomb's Law determines the repulsive or attractive force acting on both charges, since they're a Newton's Law Force Pair (see Rule 76). However, in addition, you must utilize this information to determine the direction of the movement of each charge. If you have a proton on the left and an electron on the right, the proton will move rightward and the electron leftward as they attract toward one another. If you have two electrons, they will move in opposite directions away from one another.</div><br><br>
