All of the knowledge present in these notes has been filtered through my personal explanations for them, the result of my attempts to understand and study them from my classes and online courses.

	  <strong><a href="#FreeFallDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="FreeFallDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Free Fall</font></strong>: A state an object can be in (granting it properties like U.A.M.) under these circumstances:<br>
	    - The only force acting on it is the Force of Gravity.<br>
	    - It is not touching any other objects.<br>
	    - There is no air resistance (the object is falling in a vacuum).<br><br>
	    
	    If an object meets all these requirements and is in free fall, then it would have a constant gravitational acceleration relative to the gravitational pull of the planet/celestial object it is on. On Earth for example, the acceleration of all objects in free fall is -9.81 m/s² in the y-direction. See Rule 14 for more information.

	    <!--I believe that with the revisal of the gravitational acceleration Rule on June 23rd, the death of small-Rule hk was sealed. The Rule more than quadrupled in length and yet became miles more cohesive and referable for future Rules. The deletion of the "additional facts" Rule only served as the last nail in the coffin as the site focus has become progressively more all-encompassing and comprehensive in its approach to the treatment of its various subjects, to the point where every Rule carries with it the expectation of either explaining a particular concept to the fullest degree possible (supplying with it the necessary analogies and examples that make the concept easier to comprehend and understand in the mind of the first-time learner), or containing references to the other Rules that can completely cover the scope of the topic for anything the Rule misses - the later is pretty much how all of Electromagnetism has gone. This is a good thing, and I am pushing this approach during revisals as it makes the project more encyclopedic and focused in its approach. It is not the notes taken by a child on a subject, it is content prepared with a specific pedagogic idea in mind serving to present itself for the broadest possible comprehension (as many people understanding it as possible, knowledge utilitarianism).-->

        </strong> <strong>Gravitational Acceleration</strong>:<br><br>
        
        <strong>g<sub>Earth</sub> = 9.81 m/s²</strong> (when in free fall)<br><br>
        
        The <strong>Acceleration due to Gravity</strong> on any planet or space thing is described using the variable '<strong>g</strong>'. In and of itself, g cannot be negative as it merely represents an attractive force acting upon an object.<br><br>
        
        On Earth, for example, the gravitational pull of the planet is described as g<sub>Earth</sub> = 9.81 m/s². From a global perspective, g<sub>Earth</sub> is not constant at all locations on the planet. However, from a local perspective, the acceleration due to gravity is constant, and should always be considered as such when solving a problem.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Never accidentally use g<sub>Earth</sub> for another planet</strong>. Other planets/celestial objects have their own gravitational acceleration constants which will likely be given by the problem (or left as an exercise for the reader to determine). For example, g<sub>Mars</sub> = 3.73 m/s².<br><Br>
        
        The acceleration due to gravity, g, is the same no matter the mass of the object. The mass of the planet, however, will alter g as the gravitational pull of the planet will differ.<br><br><Br><Br>
        
        
        
        
        <strong>a<sub>y Earth</sub> = -9.81 m/s²</strong> (when in free fall)<br><br>
        
        When direction is considered in relation to the gravitational pull, and the xy-plane upon which the object exists is acknowledged (as it will <u>be</u><!--emphasis here, not on will--> in practically all Physics problems), then the downward gravitational pull towards the center of the planet will produce a <em>negative</em> acceleration relative to the object's plane (when in free fall).<br><Br>
        
        Thus, <strong>a<sub>y</sub></strong>, the <strong>Acceleration due to Gravity in the Y-direction</strong> (for free fall on planet earth), is -9.81 m/s², or -g. Note that this can also be represented as 9.81 m/s² Down, but NEVER as -9.81 m/s² Down (which is in effect 9.81 m/s² Up, or reverse gravity).<br><br>
        
        
        No matter the positioning of the object (if its tilted or not), the acceleration due to gravity will remain pointed directly downward towards the center of the planet/celestial body. Additionally, note that gravitational force (the force causing the acceleration), which will be described in Section VI, is also always pointed directly downward towards the center of the planet regardless of whether the object is tilted or not; See Rule 60.<br><Br>
        
        
      The Acceleration due to Gravity must not be confused with the Acceleration due to Gravity in the Y-direction. In practice, the former, g alone (without the negative), will be used much more often in Physics problems, especially when performing free-body problems involving the <u>force</u> of gravity (discussed later on in Subsection VI.II).<br><br><br>
      
      <strong>g = Acceleration due to Gravity</strong>.<br>
      <strong>a<sub>y</sub> = Acceleration due to Gravity in the Y-direction.</strong><br><br>
      
      <strong>g<sub>Earth</sub> = 9.81 m/s².</strong> (when in free fall)<br>
      <strong>a<sub>y Earth</sub> = -9.81 m/s²</strong> (when in free fall)

      <!--R.I.P. the former "Additional facts about gravity" Rule, which almost had a childlike charm to its simplicity. It harked back to an age where hkp was literally just a note compilation project and not an attempt to make more accessible all of the human knowledge. Good times.-->

        </strong> <strong>Splitting U.A.M. Calculations</strong>:<br><Br>
        
        Sometimes, when you are dealing with an object in free fall that changes direction (such as when gravity pulls down an upward initially thrown upward), <strong>splitting your calculations into two parts</strong> (or more!) is necessary in order to find information that serves the problem as a whole.<br><br>
        
        For example, if you were to take a ball and throw it up in the air, catching it at the same y-value that you threw it, the change in position would be 0, making it impossible to find the change in time using the entirety of the event. Thus, one has to split the movement of the object into the periods before and after it passed the critical point (the point mid-air in which the ball stops moving upward and effectively pauses for a moment before it begins falling), with the period of the ball moving upward and the period of it falling downward being dealt with separately in calculations (<strong>different U.A.M. <em></em>sessions</strong><!--I don't know why, but I particularly like this metaphor, it conveys what I want to say in a way familiar to me (computers, "active sessions"), in the same way that people ask for something to be explained in lebron james terms--> as it were, which may share some variables but represent different periods of movement).<br><br>
        
        After separation, the values from the different sessions can be stitched together to provide a more complete view of the entire movement sequence of the object.<!--I had the vision for this entire sentence all at once and had to write it extremely quickly before I could forget. Rarely do I get very fast-acting inspiration, I am usually quite slowing in forming words--> The total change in time for the example event, if the ball lands in the same place where it was thrown, would be the change in time of either half of the event doubled, due to symmetry. If the ball lands somewhere other than where it was thrown, then the time for each half would have to be calculated and then added together to find the total time.

	    <strong><font color="blue"><a href="#CommonMistakes"><span class="mw-headline" id="CommonMistakes">#</span></a> Common Mistakes in Free Fall:</font></strong><br><br>
	    
	    <strong>1.</strong> When you throw a ball upward, that does not mean that it will have a positive acceleration. Having such would make it shoot upward like a rocket. Gravity is a positive constant, but the acceleration in the <em>y-direction</em> during free fall is -9.81 m/s² for any object, regardless of whether it is moving upward or downward (and if it is moving upward in free fall, it is sure as hell to start moving downward soon thereafter!). See Rule 14 for more information regarding gravitational acceleration.<br><br>
	    
	    <strong>2.</strong> Objects thrown upward do not have an initial velocity of 0 (atleast in the y-direction) - they already have a positive velocity before being thrown due to the force applied by whatever is throwing them. An initial velocity of zero in the y-direction will not cause an object to move upward - the initial velocity must be positive. <br><br>
	    
	    <strong>3.</strong> The force with which an object is thrown will not effect the acceleration in the y-direction. Regardless of whether a ball is dropped or thrown downward, the acceleration in the y direction will be -9.81 m/s², and only the position and velocity will change to reflect this force. If an object is thrown down at 100 km/hr, it will be accelerating as fast as an object that was only dropped, because while acceleration affects velocity, velocity does not affect gravitational acceleration.<!--velocity will affect acceleration with regard to forces that have velocity in their equations, like magnetic force and drag. Also special relativity is wack, so I hear-->
