<strong>Rotational Motion</strong> = The movement of an object through circular motion about its center of mass.<br><br>

A BICYCLE will be in both Translational and Rotational motion when it is in use.  <br><br><br>

	  <strong>I</strong> = Moment of Inertia.<br>
	  <strong>m</strong> = The mass of each particle.<br>
	  <strong>r</strong> = The distance each particle is from the axis of rotation (the center of the rotation).<br><br><br>

	  <u>Definition</u>: Also known as <strong>Rotational Mass</strong> or <strong>Rotational Inertia</strong>. A measure of resistance to <u>Angular Acceleration</u>, as opposed to Inertial mass, which is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration in general. The full derivation of the formula (and how it connects into Rotational Kinetic Energy) is outlined in Rule 124.<br><br>
In essence, this is saying that as the distance from the axis of rotation increases, so will the moment of inertia. For example - if you have a broom and you try to rotate it from the brush, it will not be too difficult since most of the mass is located by the brush, but if you were to try to rotate the broom from the top of the handle, it will be much more difficult as the bulk of the mass has dramatically increased in its distance from the center of the rotation.
	  
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule124"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule124">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 124.</font></strong> <strong>Kinetic Energy of Rotation:</strong><br><br>
      
      The Kinetic Energy of old has failed us. Since the classic kinetic energy formula is only with regard to the center of mass of the object (this is called "translational" kinetic energy), a uniform object in rotational motion would be considered to have zero kinetic energy - ignorantly. This equation is inadequate to deal with such pressing questions of modern physics as the kinetic energy contained in a spinning object - all objects in motion must have kinetic energy.<br><br>
      Thus, a new form of kinetic energy must be discovered: the summation of the kinetic energies of every particle of the system, in the process reimagining the object as a system of particles, each with its own velocity that can contribute to the whole:
      $$\sum_{n=1} \frac{1}{2} m_n \left(v_n\right)^2$$
      
      Since the velocity in this equation is the tangential velocity, the formula of tangential velocity can be substituted in, producing the following:
      
      $$\sum_{n=1} \frac{1}{2} m_n\,\, r_n^2\,\,\, ω^2$$
      
      In all rigid objects with a constant shape, the angular velocity of each particle is the same, and so there is no need for the n subscript to be applied to the ω. Thus, when removing all constants from the equation, you are left with what is known as the <strong>Moment of Inertia</strong>, represented as the letter I:
      $$I = \sum_{n=1} m_n\,\, r_n^2$$
      Now, the <strong>Rotational Kinetic Energy</strong> equation has been created: <strong>(1/2) × I × ω²</strong>. The old Translational Kinetic Energy equation ((1/2) × m × v²) was only concerned with the motion of the center of mass of the object, and now, we can use the rotational KE to determine the energy of objects that are merely spinning.

        Here are the Moments of Inertia of some basic rigid objects with constant density. Recall that 'M' is m<sub>total</sub>.<br><br>
        <strong>Type, Axis of Rotation</strong><br><br>
        
        Thin rod of length L, about its center of mass: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = (1/12) × M × L²</strong><br><br>
        
        Thin rod of length L, about one end: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = (1/3) × M × L²</strong><br><br>
        
        Thin hollow cylinder (hoop), about its long cylindrical axis: <strong>I = MR²</strong><br><br>
        
        Solid cylinder, about its long cylindrical axis: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = (1/2) × M × R²</strong><br><br>
        
        Solid sphere, about its center of mass: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = (2/5) × M × R²</strong><br><br>
        
        Thin hollow sphere, about its center of mass: <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = (2/3) × M × R²</strong><br><br><br>
        
        Note that in all where length is irrelevant to the moment of inertia, such as with the cylinders, an object of that type of any length will have the same moment of inertia, from a ring to a mile-long tube.

	   <u>Units</u>: Newton Meters (Joules). When in reference to Torque, the explicit units "Newton Meters" are used instead of "Joules" to differentiate it from the Scalar units of Work and Kinetic Energy.<br><br>
	  
	  <u>Equation</u>:<br><br> <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>&tau;</strong></span> = <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> × <span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span> × sinθ</strong>

	  <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>&tau;</strong></span></strong> = Torque.<br><br>
	  <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span></strong> = The force causing the torque.<br><br>
	  <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span></strong> = The position vector from the axis of rotation to the point the force is applied to the object, with the magnitude being the base distance. Also known as the "moment arm" or the "lever arm" (see definition).<br><br>
	  <strong>θ</strong> = The angle between the direction of <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> and the direction of <span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span>.<br><br><br>

	  <u>Definition</u>: The ability of a force to cause an <u>angular acceleration</u> in an object. Just as translational motion is caused by a net <em>force</em> (the ability to cause an acceleration in an object), <em>rotational</em> motion is caused by a net <strong>torque</strong>. Of course, torque is caused by a force.<br><br>
	  The direction of torque, being a result of the cross product, requires only the traditional right-hand rule for determination, back in <a href="/Physics/MechanicsFull#VectorMultiplyVector">section III.III</a>. Note that torque is in the same direction as the angular acceleration that it produces, which is also the same direction as the angular velocity or angular displacement, determined through the Rotational RHR (see Rule 53). Choose which one you use based on the parameters of the problem/situation. Either rule patently does <u>not</u> give you the direction of force - figure that out using vector decomposition or something else.

	    Think of the opening of a door: The door handle will be positioned as far from the hinges as possible, since the hinges represent the axis of rotation. If you push on the part of the door close to the hinges, it will barely budge. This is because by pushing farther away from the hinges, a larger r value is created (thus producing more torque), and by pushing close the hinges, a smaller r value is created, thus creating less torque.
	    
	    <br><br> Furthermore, the angle at which the door is pushed will matter significantly due to the sin curve - the maximum value for the sine of angle is at 90 degrees (1), so pushing perpendicular to the door will result in the most angular acceleration, while other degrees will produce less. A perpendicular force would produce the minimum force necessary to produce torque - other angles at which force can be applied would require higher magnitudes of force to reach the same level of torque. If you push directly parallelly to the direction of <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span>, e.g. directly toward the hinges from the side of the handle, then an angle of 180 will be created, resulting in no torque whatsoever (since sin(180) = 0).<br><br>
	    
	    <STRONG>UNDERSTANDING OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE:</STRONG><BR><BR>

θ represents the angle between the <strong><u>DIRECTIONS</u></strong> of <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> and <span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span>. You must always be careful to determine the directions of <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> and <span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span> before you make any judgements as to θ.<br><br>
Understand that the direction of the <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> vector is whichever one in which the distance from the axis of rotation is <u>increasing</u>. Thus, for a door, the direction will be toward the knob and away from the hinges. An example of these concepts can be seen in the figure below, which depicts a door with an unusual force being applied and the resultant θ:<br><br>

	    Torque is NOT the same as work - torque uses the <u>direction</u> of the variables.

The "<strong>line of action</strong>" is just the artificial extension of the force through space until it can form a right angle with the also artificially created "moment arm".

Imagine that <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> and <span class="vecteur"><strong>F</strong></span> are two sides of a right triangle. The third side, which will never be the hypotenuse, is a component of the <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> position vector. The third side will thus be perpendicular to the force, and, as the perpendicular component of <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span>, is known as the <strong>"moment arm"</strong> or the <strong>"lever arm"</strong>.<br><br>
When θ is 90 degrees (a perpendicular force), then <span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> and the moment arm are equal in magnitude, and the Force is the hypotenuse.<br><br>

Through the forces of trigonometry, the moment arm is equal to <strong><span class="vecteur"><strong>r</strong></span> × sinθ</strong>, since the sine of any supplementary angles (θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> in the figure) will produce the same value, as one can demonstrate using the sine curve.<br><br>

      <strong><a href="#Rule126"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule126">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 126.</font></strong> The sum the torques of the various forces acting upon a position vector, you merely have to add all of the calculated torques of each force together. Make sure to determine the direction of each torque using the right-hand rule, as this will tell you which torques are negative or positive. The sign of your answer will serve as the "direction" of the torque, either positively or negatively perpendicular to the force and position vector.<br><br>
      When summing the torques, you have to sum the torque of EVERY force, including gravity and the normal force. If the axis of rotation is centered at the center of mass, then the torque of gravity and the normal force can be set to zero since they have an <span class="vecteur">r</span> of 0.
      
      <br><br><br>
      
      <strong><a href="#Rule127"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule127">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 127.</font></strong> <strong>Rotational Form of Newton's Second Law:</strong><br><br>
      <strong>&Sigma;<span class="vecteur"><strong>&tau;</strong></span> = I × <span class="vecteur"><strong>α</strong></span></strong>. <br><br>The sum of the torque is equal to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration. The angular acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net torque,and is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. <br><br>
In order to use this equation, you must identify the objects with torque, the axis of rotation of them, and which direction is positive torque. 
      
      
      <br><br><br><br>
      
      <strong><font color="#006400"><a href="#RotateEquilibriumDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="RotateEquilibriumDef">#</span></a> Rotational Equilibrium</font></strong>: When, as a result of a net zero torque (which in turn causes zero angular acceleration), the object remains at rest or at a constant angular velocity.

<br><br>
This is just like Translational Equilibrium, which is when a net force of zero on an object (and thus zero acceleration) results in the object being either at rest or at a constant velocity.<br><br>

Note that it is impossible for the rotational inertia to be equal to zero so long as there is any mass located away from the axis of rotation, which is in all rela circumstances.<br><br><br>
      
      <strong><font color="#006400"><a href="#StaticEquilibriumDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="StaticEquilibriumDef">#</span></a> Static Equilibrium</font></strong>: A state in which an object is at rest and not rotating. Thus, the object is in both Translation and Rotational Equilibrium at the same time. Additionally, the net torque of <u>any</u> axis of rotation will equal zero.<br><br>
      The ability to use both torque and regular force equations can be super useful, especially with the ability to place the axis of rotation on any spot (and thus nullifying any forces acting on that spot in the torque equations, since the <span class="vecteur">r</span> for that force would be zero).
      
      <br><br><br>
      
      <strong><a href="#Rule128"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule128">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 128.</font></strong> In all situations, if there are objects that are on top of other objects, and you are including the bottom objects in your force summation, then you do not need to include the force normals of the objects on top, only their forces of gravity. This is because the weight of the top objects will just contribute to the force normal of the bottom object.<br><br>
      
      Secondly, ALWAYS include ALL of the objects in the summation of the torques, including the objects on bottom and on top and anything in between. When determining if the torques are positive or not, don't forget you need to use the old right hand rule to figure it out, using the forces as your guide.
      
      <br><br><br><!--homework rules: rules that were created when actually out in the field appliying the base knowledge of the previous, lecture rules, into practice, thus gaining actually useful insight into how problems relating to a concept will generally work. For the student, homework rules will be much more valuable, but for the reviewer before the test, the lecture rules are what you want to look at. -->
      
      <strong><a href="#Rule129"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule129">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 129.</font></strong> To solve static equilibrium problems, you can chose 1 of two placements of the axis of rotation for your torque summations: 
      <br><br> 1. You can set the axis of rotation all the way to the end of the main object (the saw or meterstick or whichever similar object), which can best be done in circumstances where the force normal has already been determined (whether through the y-direction force summation or other means). 
      <br><br>2. You can set the axis of rotation to be at an exact point, whether one you want to find (such as a point whose <span class="vecteur">r</span> value you are trying to find) or one you want to remove all together in order to isolate another variable (in situations which you have two unknown variables, and placing the axis of rotation upon one point will remove that variable, allowing the other one to be solved).<!--Homework rule-->
