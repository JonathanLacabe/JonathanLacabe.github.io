	  What you should retain as knowledge for your life, regardless of whether you pursue Physics or if you waste your life, are these Bare Minimum fundamentals, which you must carry with you in all future pursuits.<br><Br>
	  
	  Physics is based on measurement of physical quantities. Being comfortable in <strong>dimensional analysis</strong> (conversion from one unit of measurement to another) is critical to all of Physics; it is the underlying prerequisite concept which all questions assume knowledge of.<br><br>
	  
	  There are several different systems of measurements which measure the same types of quantities, the two biggest systems being the <strong>Metric System</strong> (a.k.a. the <strong>S.I.</strong>) and the <strong>Imperial System</strong>, all others are scams<!--liberal propaganda-->. For example, length is measured in 'meters' in the metric system, while the imperial unit for length is 'feet'.<br><br> 
	  
	  Dimensional Analysis is conducted using <strong>conversion factors</strong>, which are just the ratio of units equivalent to what you are trying to convert to. For example, <br><br>(2 min) x (60 sec/1 min)<br><br> has (60 sec/1 min) as the conversion factor, converting from minutes to seconds. The conversion factor is the fraction being multiplied regardless of the coefficient of the original unit, as shown in how two minutes, 40 minutes, and 542 minutes will all have the same conversion factor when converting into seconds.

        </strong> <strong>SIGNIFICANT FIGURES:</strong><br><br>
        
        In Physics, it is convention to use '<strong>significant figures</strong>' (often abbreviated to <strong>sig. fig.'s</strong>) in all numerical answers, with the number of significant figures in the answer being equal to the <eM>least</eM> number of figures in any of the numerical values given in the question. Below is a simple set of guidelines to follow when determining how many sig. fig.'s are in any number:<br><br>
        
        <strong>1)</strong> All Non-zero digits are significant.<br>
	  <strong>2)</strong> Zeros between significant digits are significant.<br>
	  <strong>3)</strong> Zeros to the left of nonzero digits are not significant.<br>
	  <strong>4)</strong> Zeros at the end of a number are significant only if there is a decimal point present.<br><br>
	  For Example:<br>
	  1200 with 3 significant figures: 1.20 x 10³<br>
	  0.002 with 3 significant figures: 2.00 x 10⁻³

        </strong> <strong><u>THE ARCANE ROUNDING RULE</u></strong>:<br><br>
        
        <strong>If the number ends in a perfect 5, round to the even number.</strong><br><br>
        
        For Example:<br>
	      275 with 2 Significant figures: 280
	      1030 x 5.1 = 5300

	  <strong><font color="blue"><a href="#AMU"><span class="mw-headline" id="AMU">#</span></a> Atomic Mass Units:</font></strong><br>
	  An additional unit of measurement (derived from kg) specific to atoms (and only occasionally relevant to elementary Physics) is the <strong>Atomic Mass Unit</strong>, found as the atomic mass of each element in relation to that of Carbon-12. For those familiar with stoichiometry, the amu can be converted to moles easily.<br><br>
	  
	  For Mechanics and Electromagnetism, idealized particles or electrons/protons are generally used instead of atoms of a specific element, so only a more peripheral understanding of amu is needed (until higher level Nuclear Physics that have an emphasis on that sort of thing).

	    <strong><font color="blue"><a href="#density"><span class="mw-headline" id="density">#</span></a> Density:</font></strong><br>
	    The density d of a material (the amount of mass in a given space) is the mass per unit volume:<br><br> <strong>d = (m / V)</strong><br><br>The majority of the time, one will see a density listed in Kilograms (or another metric weight) per cubic meter (or another length, such as cm³). The density of water, for example, is 1.00 grams per cm³.

	    <strong><font color="blue"><a href="#VerticalScaling"><span class="mw-headline" id="VerticalScaling">#</span></a> Vertical Scaling:</font></strong><br>
	    When you have a problem such as that shown below, the "<strong>vertical scaling</strong>" is just referring to what the given height value (v<sub>s</sub>) is as each y-value is multiplied by a constant, creating a ratio between the <u>new</u> and <u>original</u> scales.<br><br>
	    
	    The <strong>old scale</strong> will almost always be a scaling of 1:1 (i.e. the normal graph), and the <strong>new scale</strong> will have a scaling ratio determined by the vertical scaling and its positioning on the graph.<br><br>
	    
	    For example, the new scale as depicted in the graph below has a ratio of 2:1 with the old graph, demonstrated by how v<sub>s</sub> is four units upward, meaning each unit is two. The exact same process can be applied to the x-axis, resulting in <strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong>.<br><br>

        </strong> When converting exponentiated units (², ³, etc.) using dimensional analysis, put the exponent on the outside of the parenthesis of the conversion factor (see "The Bare Minimum" blue section), applying the exponent to the top and bottom (both to the units and the conversion factor values) in order to allow units to cancel out:<br><br>

	    Here is a beginning problem that should be common sense to any beginning physicist well-versed in dimensional analysis:<br><br>
	    <em>Iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm³, and the mass of an iron atom is 9.27 × 10⁻²⁶ kg. If the atoms are spherical and tightly packed, <br>(a) what is the volume of an iron atom and <br>(b) what is the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms?</em><br><br>
	    Of course, you always want all of your measurements to be in the same units, so we will first convert the grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters:<br><br>
	    d = (7.87 g/cm³) × (1 kg / 1000 g) × (100 cm / 1 hr)³<br>d = 7.87 × 10³ kg/m³<br><br>Now lets move on to finding the volume of the iron atom. For this, we need to remember our previous knowns of density, mass, and volume: d = (m / V) Thus, our first step must be to isolate the volume since we already know the density and mass.
	    <br><br> (9.27 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) / (7.87 × 10³ kg/m³)<br><br>This gives us a result of 1.18 × 10⁻²⁹ m³ the volume of an iron atom.<br>Next, for part b, we need to find the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms. Using critical thinking, we can determine that this distance is in fact the diameter of the atom, which we can reverse engineer by isolating the radius from the volume equation of a sphere:<br><br>Volume of sphere = (4/3) × π × r³.<br> r = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&#8731;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">(3V / 4π)</span></span><br><br>Plugging in the known volume from answer a), we find that the radius is equal 1.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters. Since we are looking for the diameter, we multiply this distance by two and get <strong>2.82 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters</strong>.

	    The equation for displacement (using <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> for displacement) in terms of unit vectors (see Rule 22) is <span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span> = (<span class="vecteur"><strong>x₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>x₁</strong></span>)i&#x302; + (<span class="vecteur"><strong>y₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>y₁</strong></span>)j&#x302;. This equation describes displacement in terms of its component vectors on the x-axis and y-axis. These component vectors indicate the direction and magnitude of the displacement.<br><br>
	    
	    In order to find displacement in the graphical sense, where you have two dots on a graph (the start and endpoints) and you need to find the straight-line distance between them, you must first find the component vectors in the x and y directions: this will allow you to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the x and y component vectors (see Rule 20 & Rule 21). <br><br>The following equation can be used to find the magnitude of the displacement in the explicit numerical/graphical sense - the exact straight-line distance between any two points: <br>
	    |<span class="vecteur"><strong>d</strong></span>| = <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">((<span class="vecteur"><strong>x₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>x₁</strong></span>)² + (<span class="vecteur"><strong>y₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>y₁</strong></span>)²)</span></span><br><br> 
	    
	    Use this equation when prompted to find the <em>magnitude</em> of the displacement - the direction can be determined by the component vectors themselves; see Rule 22.<br><br>
	    
	    NOTE THAT THE DISPLACEMENT EQUATION AND SEEING DISPLACEMENT AS A VECTOR IS NOT NECESSARY IF THE OBJECT IS ONLY MOVING ALONG A SINGLE AXIS. If the position is only moving along one axis, then you only need to subtract y<sub>final</sub> by y<sub>initial</sub> or x<sub>final</sub> by x<sub>initial</sub> to find displacement. If the equation is in 2D, then you want to use the equation as stated, and if it is in 3D, then you should just add + (<span class="vecteur"><strong>z₂</strong></span> - <span class="vecteur"><strong>z₁</strong></span>)k&#x302;, if you are are calculating displacement in unit vectors, or + z², if you are calculating the magnitude. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpK50co6ZcY">Useful proof</a>.

        </strong> <strong>Speed</strong>:<br><br>
        
        <strong>Speed</strong> is the magnitude version of velocity, utilizing the total distance traveled by an object instead of displacement. Because Velocity accounts for displacement, but speed only for distance traveled, they will only share the same magnitude when moving in a straight line. The velocity is specifically in straight-line distance, so if the line is curved, the end point and the initial point are the only things that are going to be used in a velocity calculation. However, the speed of that curve would be the length of the entire line, all of distance traveled between point a and point b. 
        
        Speed = v = (total distance) / (time).<br><br>
        
        As seen above, speed using the same symbol as velocity, with the specific one being used in a given question being discernable by the context of the problem.

	     In your reading of Velocity and Slope, you have no doubt read these two truths:<br><br>
	     <strong>Velocity = ∆x / ∆t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Displacement / Change in Time)<br>
	     Slope = ∆y / ∆x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Change in Y / Change in X)<br>
	     Velocity = Slope</strong>
	     <br><br>
	    The '∆x' of slope is not referring to displacement, but rather the change in the x position. This is constant cause of confusion, but know that in the majority of cases unless expressly obvious otherwise, '∆x' is in reference to displacement, the change in position.<br>
	    Here are the two equations shown as equivalent:<br><br>
	    ∆x<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;∆y<br>
	    ━━&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;━━<br>
	    ∆t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hairsp;∆x<sub>2</sub><br><br>
	    
	    Since the two equations are known to be equivalent, we known that the ∆x<sub>1</sub> of displacement and ∆x<sub>2</sub> of slope are not the same, as if we were to cancel out the ∆x of the right side by multiplying it by both sides, we would find that ∆x² / ∆t is equal to ∆y, which is total nonsense. The key to understanding how this statement is true (and how the ∆x is referring to two things simultaneously) is to realize that both equations are stating the same ratio, just in terms of different graphs.<br>

	    The <strong>Uniformly Accelerated Motion</strong> (<strong>U.A.M.</strong>) equations are only to be used when an object is moving with an acceleration that is constant. E.g., in calculus terms, the object has a position represented by an equation with an exponent no higher than two (a quadratic) in its time graph. U.A.M. allows the physicist to use 5 special equations not allowed otherwise:<br><br>
	    
	    1. <strong>V<sub>F</sub> = V<sub>i</sub> + (a × ∆t).</strong><br>
	    Velocity Final is equal to velocity initial plus the acceleration multiplied by the change in time.<br><br>
      2. <strong>∆x = (V<sub>i</sub> × ∆t) + (1/2 × a × ∆t²)</strong><br>
	    Displacement is equal to velocity initial multiplied by the change in time, plus 1/2 multiplied by acceleration and the change in time squared.<br><br>
      3. <strong>V<sub>F</sub>² = V<sub>i</sub>² + (2 × a × ∆x)</strong><br>
	    Velocity final squared is equal to velocity initial squared plus two multiplied by the acceleration and the displacement.<br><br>
      4. <strong>∆x = (1/2) × (V<sub>F</sub> + V<sub>i</sub>) × ∆t</strong><br>
	    The change in position is equal to one half times the quantity of velocity final plus velocity initial.<br><br>
	    <strong>V<sub>F</sub></strong> = Velocity final<br>
	    <strong>V<sub>i</sub></strong> = Velocity initial<br>
	    <strong>a</strong> = Acceleration<br>
	    <strong>∆t</strong> = Change in time<br>
	    <strong>∆x</strong> = Displacement (or change in position)<br><br>
	    <strong>YOU CAN CHANGE DISPLACEMENT TO BE CHANGE IN Y IF YOU NEED TO, SUCH AS IN FREE FALL EQUATIONS.</strong><br><br><br>
	    Additionally, there are some lame 'alternate' versions of these equations using slightly different variables that are useful for deriving and integrating the equations:<br>
	    v = v<sub>0</sub> + at<br>
	    x = x<sub>0</sub> + v<sub>0</sub>t + (1/2) × at²<br>
	    v² = v<sub>0</sub>² + 2a(x - x<sub>0</sub>)<br>
	    x = x<sub>0</sub> + (1/2) × (v + v<sub>0</sub>) × t<br>

        </strong> There are 5 U.A.M. variables, and there are 4 equations. If you know 3 variables, you can find the other 2, leaving 1 happy Physics student. The highest exponent in the position equation must be 2 or below for U.A.M. to be active. If the highest exponent is three or above, the object is not in Uniformly Accelerated Motion. These are also referred to as the <strong>kinematic equations</strong>, the equations that govern motion (when ignoring thing like drag/air resistance - see Subsection III.IV for that). For motion in two dimensions, see Subsection III.III.
	    <br><br> If you have two equations, and you know they have three of the same U.A.M. variables, you will know that the other two have to be the same as well. In the classic bullet equation, where we knew the fired bullet and dropped bullet had a Δy of -h, an acceleration of -9.81 m/s², and a V<sub>iy</sub> of 0, we could determine that the time it would tell them to hit the ground would be the same (considering how time is the same for the x-direction and y-direction - see Rule 27 and the rest of Projectile Motion for more information).

	    A use of the U.A.M. equations that is not immediately apparent:<br><br> <em>Two trains, each having a speed of 30 km/h, are headed at each other on the same straight track. A bird that can fly 60 km/h flies off the front of one train when they are 60 km apart and heads directly for the other train. On reaching the other train, the (crazy) bird flies directly back to the first train, and so forth. What is the total distance the bird travels before the trains collide?</em><br><br>
	    
	    This question has several traits that force the physicist to utilize critical thinking skills instead of plugging in numbers into formulas mindlessly, which one may get in the habit of if asked too many uninspired questions. <br><br>
	    For one, velocity cannot replace speed in most circumstances due to the inherent differences of velocity being straight-line difference and speed being the total distance traveled, but there is one exception: If the object (or objects, in this case) travel in a straight-line, which is to say in one dimension, then the speed is equal to the velocity and they are interchangeable.<br><br>
	    The specific parameters of the problem make it easier to solve: image the trains as being simple objects with directionless speed (as stated in the problem), for example. From the perspective of the conductor of the first train, the second train is going 60 kilometers per hour. We can replace the entire two train scenario (which has perfect symmetry and identical U.A.M. variables) and replace it with a single moving object - the trains are individually moving 30 km/hr towards eachother at a starting distance of 60 km from eachother - this is equal to a single train moving at 60 km/hr toward a brick wall 60 km away. Mathematically, these conclusions can be derived as follows:<br><br>
	    
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = Speed<sub>1</sub> + Speed<sub>2</sub><br>
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = 30 km/hr + 30 km/hr<br>
	    Speed<sub>Total</sub> = 60 km/hr
	    
	    <br><br>
	    Thus, in this question, V<sub>iT</sub> and V<sub>FT</sub> are in reference to the single moving train, are all equal to 60 km/hr. Additionally, the change in x has been changed to 60 km, and considering the doubled speed of the single train, this works out perfectly with the original scenario. Since there are three known variables, we can find the other two.<br>
	    <br>For this question only, it seems more logical to remain in km/hr instead of converting into m/s as is the usual.<br><br>
	    We will first try to get the acceleration out of the train's U.A.M. equations - each equation has acceleration, so we need it to get to what we really want - the change in time.<br><br>
	    V<sub>F1</sub>² = V<sub>i1</sub>² + 2 × a × ∆x<br>
	    (60 km/hr)² = (60 km/hr)² + 2 × a × 60 km.<br>
	    0 = 2 × a × 60 km.<br>
	    a = 0<br><br>
	    This simplifies things significantly. Thus, for the second equation, which has two parts, both with the change in time, and the second with acceleration as a multiplier, is best suited for this scenario, as it can directly reveal the change in time.<br><br>
	    ∆x = V<sub>i1</sub> × ∆t + (1 / 2) × a × (∆t)²<br>
	    60 km = (60 km/hr) × ∆t<br>
	    ∆t = 1<br><br>
	    
	    This is also very useful. If we were to consider the flying bird, we would find that it is flying at the same speed as the train and would thus go 60 km/hr for one hour before crashing into the wall, which is clearly equal to 1 hours worth of flight and thus 60 km of flight distance.
	    <br> Utilizing vector addition (see Rule 18) would not work, because the directions would cause the train velocities to cancel out.

        </strong> An average velocity written as V<sub>(5-10 sec)</sub> is just (x<sub>10</sub> - x<sub>5</sub>) / (t<sub>10</sub> - t<sub>5</sub>). This style of writing, although can be misinterpreted as meaning V<sub>-5</sub>, specifies an interval on the graph to find the velocity of.
