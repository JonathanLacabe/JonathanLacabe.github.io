Every Tom, Dick, & Harry who ever waltzed into a Physics laboratory and did anything or picked their nose has some nonsense named after them. Laws that are named after people only obfuscate their actual nature, and render Physics into a sport of vanity, diluting its beyond-human purpose. Thus, in all possible instances, I have dehumanized Physics. Constants and Units I've found stubbornly immutable (so keep your damn Newtons and Farads), but every principle and law possible, I have renamed.
Of course, there are several quotes on the project that have named attributions. These quotes exist outside of the main content (the "knowledge" as it were), in a sort of inter-project space. They exist within the medium (the website and its organization) with which the knowledge is disclosed, but are not a part of the knowledge itself - this is a far cry from the outright interference in the knowledge that the named laws and principles have. In any case, I like well-written prose, and the quotes imbue a sort of mystique or profound nature (excuse Carlin) that is perfectly suited to the philosophy of the project, and so the quotes will remain forever. I am not outright anti-humanist - rather, only in relation to scientific pursuits.

As "True greatness is when your name is spelled with a lower case letter", Units named after individuals will begrudgingly be used, and always Capitalized.

Idea: Name the rules/law after an identifiable idiosyncratic trait, like gluons. Idiot terms, like Bosons, will be more difficult to deal with. Naming everything boring things like "Law of Electric Force" nullifies the individuality and memorability of the law. Imagine if the Quotient Rule was called the "Derivative Divisibility Rule" - sometimes, it is better to name a law something less specific if it means it is easier to memorize, especially if that memorable name directly deals with something inherent and distinctive to a property of the law.


Hooke's Law -> Law of Elasticity
Coulomb's Law -> Law of Electric Force
Gauss's Law -> Charge-Flux Law
Ohm's Law -> VCR Law (it encapsulates the three things relevant to the law, and it already sounds familiar, because VCR)
