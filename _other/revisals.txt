=====REVISALS=====
In fully forming and improving the content of the Human Knowledge Project, I will undergo full-scale revisions of various topic sections or subsections. This page is meant to log my work in doing so, including how long it took me for each section. I am currently in the process of revising my Physics notes, though you can check when my last completed revisal was, as I tend to work concentratedly in a particular discipline all at once and may be working on a subject other than Physics right now (probably Calculus or Cryptography).
