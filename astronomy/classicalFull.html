	    <p>These are my complete notes for Classical Astronomy, covering topics from throughout the progression of Astronomy, from the ancient beliefs of Aristotle and Ptolemy, to the more modern developments that have contributed to our currrent understanding of the cosmos, such as the revelations of Copernicus and Newton. <br><br>
	    <u><strong>NOTE</strong>: This section differs from other categories on the site and within Astronomy itself, because the Rules are written more narratively and are much less dense in their information. This is only the case for Classical Astronomy, which deals with many of the characters that existed throughout the early developments of Astronomy, like Ptolemy, Galileo, and Kepler.</u>
	    <br><br>I color-coded my notes according to their meaning - for a complete reference for each type of note, see <a href="/information/color.html">here</a> (also available in the sidebar). All of the knowledge present in these notes has been filtered through my personal explanations for them, the result of my attempts to understand and study them from my classes and online courses.

	  <strong><font color="#006400">Astronomy</font></strong>: The study of the objects that use beyond planet Earth and the processes by which these objects interact with eachother. Organization of a history of the Universe, from the Big Bang to the present. "Science is the progress report of the progress report probing of the secrets of the Universe" - Charles Bailyn.
<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><font color="#006400">Light-Speed</font></strong>: The distance which light travels within one year. This is 9.46 × 10¹² kilometers per year. Light travels through the Universe at this constant. The stars outside are only sending their light at lightspeed, so if one is 20 lightyears away, Earth will only see the stars as it looked 20 years previously. Therefore, we can learn about what happened billions of years ago, at the dawn of the Universe, by looking at stars farther away.
<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><font color="#006400">Astronomical Units</font></strong>: The distance between the Sun and the Earth. Light travels from the sun over 8 minutes to the Earth. 1 year is the length of time it takes the Earth to rotate around the Sun. Our velocity with respect to Earth is zero, but with respect to the Sun, we're moving 110,000 kilometers per second due to the Earth's orbit. This is <a href="/Physics/mechanics/range">Relative Motion & Velocity</a>, which is mathematically elaborated on in Classical Physics.
<br><br><br>
	  
	 

	    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 1.</font></strong> There are eight planets that orbit around the sun along with bunches of other bodies like moons, dwarf planets, and whatever. These make up the solar system we live in. <strong>Planets</strong> are celestial bodies of significant size that orbits a star. If the planet consistently produces its own light, it is a star.<br><br>

	    The Sun being our local star, and stars themselves are basically just enormous balls of bglowing gas which generate energy by internal nuclear reactions.
	    <br><br><br>
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 2.</font></strong> All of the stars visible out in the sky are a part of the <strong>Mily Way Galaxy</strong> - there are hundreds of billions of more stars in our galaxy, and hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. The Milky Way Galaxy is like a giant disk with a small ball in the middle. The space between the stars is actually not completely empty: there is a sparse distribution of gas intermixed with tiny particles called <strong>interstellar dust</strong>. The gas and dust will collect into huge clouds in the galaxy, which will form the raw material for future star generations. This interstellar dust is extremely sparse, however, so sparse still serves as a great vacuum. Built-up dust is the space smog, blocking the view of more distant regions of the galaxy to Earth.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 3.</font></strong> Because of experimental/observational evidence proving that there is some unknown material exerting gravitational force upon space objects, we know there is some "<strong>Dark Matter</strong>" that cannot be directly observed interfering with everything.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 4.</font></strong> While many solar systems only have on star (like ours), many systems are <strong>double</strong> or <strong>triple systems</strong>, with 2, 3, or more stars revolving around each other. Several places in the galaxy have so many stars they are called <strong>star clusters</strong>.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 5.</font></strong> All stars die after running out of <u>fuel</u>, because stars can only produce energy as they do while they have some fuel source. The Sun, for example, uses <strong>nuclear fusion</strong> to create fuel, converting hydrogen into helium, which releases energy in the form of light and heat. When stars die, they explode and their star dust is fed back into the Universe for reuse.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="#006400">Constellation</font></strong>: The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations">88 patches of sky</a> which humans have deliminated to simplify observations. For example: the <strong>Saggitarius Dwarf Galaxy</strong> is in the direction of the Saggitarius constellation.
<br><br><br>
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 6.</font></strong> The Milky Way Galaxy has many orbiting <strong>satellite galaxies</strong> that will eventually be incorporated/subsumed by the Milky Way Galaxy itself, such as the <strong>Magellanic Clouds</strong> and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. The nearest non-satellite galaxy to the Milky Way is the <strong>Andromeda Galaxy</strong> (of the Andromeda Constellation), and these two galaxies, along with 50 others nearvy, are called the <strong>Local Group</strong>, our local galaxy cluster. Most galaxies occur in cluster.<br><br><br>


    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 7.</font></strong> Some galaxy clusters themselves from into larger groups, called <strong>superclusters</strong>. The Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster, 110 million lightyears across. Farther away, there are <strong>quasars</strong>, the especially brilliant centers of galaxies which glow from an extremely energetic process. Normally, at the distance where we see quasars, galaxies are too dim to see, but because quasars have an energy produced by a gas heated to a temperature of millions of degrees as it gravitates toward a massive black hole and swirls around it, quasars are bright enough to be the most distant objects we can see in the expanses of space. The quasars are 10 billion plus light-years away, and thus showing us 10 billion years into the past. Beyond these quasars, astronomers detected the feeble afterglow of the Big Bang, detected from all directions in space.<br><br><br>
    
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 8.</font></strong> While the Universe is very large, it is also very sparse. In the interstellar gas of the galaxy, there is on average one atom per cubic centimeter, while in <strong>intergalactic space</strong> (much sparser than our galaxy), that number drops to one atom per cubic meter of space.<br><br><br>
    
    
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 9.</font></strong> <strong>Summary of the Atomic Level of Matter:</strong><br><br>
The smallest part of any matter (anything more complex than mono-atomic structures) are the molecules, particles that are the smallest part of the matter that retains its chemical properties. Water, for example, has the molecule H<sub>2</sub>O, three atoms bonded together. Molecules are always built of atoms, the smallest division of an element that can be identified as that element. 
<br><br>There are over 100 elements that occur in nature, but most are rare, and only a few occur with any real frequency, known as the <strong>“Cosmically Abundant”</strong> elements. Listed in descending frequency, they are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>Hydrogen </li>
<li>Helium </li>
<li>Carbon </li>
<li>Nitrogen </li>
<li>Oxygen </li>
<li>Neon </li>
<li>Magnesium </li>
<li>Silicon </li>
<li>Sulfur </li>
<li>Iron </li>
</ol>

Atoms consist of a central, positively charged <strong>nucleus</strong> surrounded by negatively charged <strong>electrons</strong>. The densest part of the atom is in the nucleus (composed of positive protons and neutral neutrons) while the majority of the mass is in the electron cloud around the nucleus. Elements are defined by the number of <strong>protons</strong> in its atoms. The distance between the nucleus to the electrons is 100K times that of the diameter of the nucleus itself. Thus, solid matter is mostly empty space, and atoms are much emptier than the solar system.

<strong><font color="#006400">Zenith</font></strong>: The point in the 'space dome' directly above you, from your perspective.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Horizon</font></strong>: The point where the space dome meets the Earth. In a flat land, the horizon would be seens as a circle around you.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Sphere</font></strong>: The ancient Greek view of the world as a sphere, of which the outermost shell had stars embedded like sky decorations.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Axis</font></strong>: The central line of the Earth going from the North Pole through the Earth to the South Pole. The Earth rotates on its axis counterclockwise, from the perspective of the Northern direction.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Pole</font></strong>: If we extend the Earth's axis into space, we find that there is now a north and south celestial pole that the stars rotate around:<br>

	    <span class="tiny"><em>The trails of the stars over many nights as a result of the rotation of the Earth around the celestial pole.</em></span><br><br>
<br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Equator</font></strong>: As an extension of the celestial poles, we can imgine Earth's equator stretching off into space.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 10.</font></strong> Way back when, everyone thought the Universe revolved around the Earth, known as the geocentric model of the Universe. This is ignorant and wrong. This idea was developed for more reasons than sheer human-centrism, however: the sun was about 1° to the east each day, relative to the stars. It takes 1 year for the sun to make a complete circle. This path is elliptic - the Sub rises 4 minutes later each day with respect to the stars. During the day, sunlight is scattered by the molecules of our atmosphere, filling our sky with light and hiding the stars above the horizon. The elliptic is not along the celestial equator (see below), but rather inclined to it at an angle of 23.5°, because Earth's axis of rotation is tilted by 23.5°. Other planets are so tilted that they orbit the sun on their side. This tilt is why the sun moves north and south in the sky as the seasons change.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 11.</font></strong> North of the equator, the north celestial pole will appear above the northern horizon at an angle equal to one's latitude - In San Francisco, 38°N, the north celestial pole is 38° above the northern horizon. The south celestial pole is thus 38° below the southern horizon, and furthermore at 38° South the southern celestial pole will be 38° above the horizon. The part of the sky however many degrees from the pole (in this case, 38°) will seem to never set, known as the <strong>circumpolar zone</strong>. There is a particular star right at the Earth's north celesetial pole that seems to move minimally during the daily rotations of the heavens: this is <strong>Polaris</strong>, the North Star.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 12.</font></strong> Apart from the sun, the other planets change their positions slightly everyday. They have their own rotational patterns, rising and setting and what not. The Greeks differentiated these bodies from the rest of the "fixed stars" by calling them planets, or wanderers. The moon has the fastest planetary motion, since it moves 12° per day. All of the planets have their paths close to the elliptic path of the sun, because the paths of the planets around the sun are all almost in exactly the same plane, like circles on a paper along with the Earth. Each of the major celestial bodies are found with an 18°-wide belt, centered on the Sun's elliptic path, known as the <strong>zodiac</strong>. The motions of the planets, as seen from Earth, are somewhat obfuscated by the movement of Earth, making the process rather complex.

<strong><font color="#006400">Astronomy</font></strong>: The science of the Universe cosmology. The art of interpreting the Universe.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Cosmology</font></strong>: The science of the cosmos, the human conceptualization and invention of understanding for the cosmos. The Mayans and Ancient Britons used calendar systems to record astronomical observations, such as the Mayan calendar and Stonehenge. A bunch of cultures developed 365 day calendars, like the Egyptians and Chinese needed for things like the timing of the flooding of the Nile River.
<br><br><br>


<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 13.</font></strong> Aristotle knew everything about Astronomy back in the day, from 384-322 B.C. - he wrote of how the moon's phases are due to the differing portions that are sunlit as the months go by. He knew the sun was farther away due to the solar eclipses, and that the Earth was spherical due to the shadow on the moon never being indicative of a disk (which would be a straight line across). He, and everyone else at the time, were also convinced that the Universe was revolving around the Earth, because the closer objects in the sky seem to move on a more still distance backdrop. This is called <strong>Parallax</strong>, the shift in direction of an object due to the perspective and motion of the observer. The perceived shift in direction of stars due to the Earth's orbital motion is called stellar parallax, and because it is practically imperceptible in more distance objects (believed to be closer due to their brightness) made only two possibilities clears to the Greeks:<br><br>

1. The Earth is not moving.<br>
2. The stars are so far away that the Parallax shift is extremely small, much like how far-away mountains do not seem to move when you are moving far away from them.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 14.</font></strong> Flat Earth is an ignoramus ideology for the following reasons: if you were to view a ship sailing across the horizon, you would find that it does not shrink and get smaller. The curvature of the Earth will interfere with your view of the ship, and the hull of the ship will disappear over the horizon before the mast does<br><br>
Secondly, if we were to assume the Earth is a disk, know would it be possible for it to be night and day on different parts of the Earth. The nature of a disk makes it so when the sun is facing it, even if the disk is turned a little, it will be day. 
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 15.</font></strong> Geometric determination of the size of the Earth.<br><br>
Because the sun is so far away, if everyone on Earth were to point at the Sun when it is visible (the entire enlightened side of the Earth), each arm would be parallel:<br><br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/astronomy/img/pointingtosun.png"><img src="/astronomy/img/pointingtosun.png" alt="The more distant an object, the closer to parallel the rays of light coming from it." width=60%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>The more distant an object, the closer to parallel the rays of light coming from it.</em></span><br><br>
 <strong>Eratosthenes</strong> found that the bottom of a well in Syrene, Egypt would be perfectly enlightened by the sun at noon on the first day of Summer. At noon of the first of Summer in Alexandria, he found that the sun was not directly overhead, but in fact off by a few degrees based on the shadow of a column. Therefore, in Alexandria the sun was roughly 7° off of what is was in Syrene. This being 1/50th of the 360° of the assumed sphere, he multiplied the distance from Syrene to Alexandria by 50 and found a rough estimate of the circumference fo the Earth.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 16.</font></strong> <strong>Hipparchus</strong> was even more hardcore in his devotion to Astronomical truth than old Eratosthenes. He catalogued the sky into a system of coordinates and brightness - the position of objects in the sky (and their charges) were catalogued in a primitive celestial latitude and longitude system, and he divided the sky into different apparent magnitudes according to their brightness - The brightest stars were of the first magnitude, for example. <br><br>He then made a horrifying discovery.<br><br>
The position of the sky of the north celestial pole, as it had appeared in the centuries prior and then, had shifted in position somewhat. The rate with which the entire sky dome rotates is slow and continuous. The North Celestial Pole is just the projection of Earth's North Pole into the sky - if the north celestial pole is wobbling around, the it is the Earth that is doing the wobbling. The motion of Earth's axis points is called <strong>precession</strong>. The Earth's wobble cycle, precession, can be illustrated by the following conical pattern:<br><br>

<br><br><br>
	   
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 16½.</font></strong> The last ancient Astronomer who wrote hugely consequential astronomical treatises was <strong>Ptolemy</strong>, who wrote a compendium of astronomical knowledge known as the Almagest in 140-ish A.D.. This book also discusses many works from the past, saving knowlege of those works for future generations. Ptolemy benefited from the mass of astronomical knowledge hoarded over the prior centuries, especially that of Hipparchus, and produced the Ptolemy model of the Universe, which no one expanded upon for thousands of years. See Rule 17 for a full description.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 17.</font></strong> 
	   One of the most infamous of baffling interpretations to rseult from the Earth rotating around the sun is the phenomenon of retrograde motion:<br><br>

By following the lines from each Earth position through each corresponding Mars position, you can see how the retrograde path of Mars looks against the background stars.</em></span><br><br>
	    Most of the year, planets will apear to move eastward as they orbit the sun, but as shown in the image, from position B to D, a planet will appear to drift backward as it is overtaken by the faster Earth, moving westward, even though it is still moving to the East. As the Earth rounds it orbit toward point E, the planet will again seem to move westward - this is <strong>Retrograde Motion</strong>. Now that the Earth is known to also be a moving planet, this is much easier to understand than the astronomical concoction of intersecting circles cooked up by Ptolemy.<br><br>
	    
	    Ptolemy's theory, the <strong>Ptolemaic Model</strong>, declared that each planet revolved in an orbit of its own, called the <strong>epicycle</strong>, while it itself is revolving around the Earth in an orbit called the <strong>Deferant</strong>. The deferant isn't even exactly centered around the Earth, obviously, it is slightly off-centered on something called the <strong>Equant point</strong>. Ptolemy invented this fantastical system by carefully calculating the speeds and distances for the movements of the celestial bodies so that 1. the movements of the of the planets matched his model, no matter how complex it was, and more importantly that 2. the model conforms to the ancient assumptions that Earth was stationary and that it was the center of the Universe. <br><br>
	    
	    While this made the model functionally correct, generally providing the positions of the stars based on its algorithmic system, it is all wrong and built off of false assumptions.

	       <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="pseudo">III. Astrology.</span></h2>
	    </header>
	    <article><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 18.</font></strong> While Astrology is all nonsense, it is interesting to learn about from a historical perspective. The seven classical wandering stars, including the sun and the moon, hold a special place in the mythos of different cities as they developed and formed their own belief systems. In humanity's most primitive state, natural phenomena will be used as a means of explaining the inexplicable universe. Weather, solar exlipses, and the patterns of bird all had divine significance. Applied to Astronomy, "<em>Astrology</em>" was born. The Babylonians used the knowledge of the stars to guide rulers in decision-making. By the 2nd century B.C., the Greeks applied Astrology to every individual - natal Astronomy was formed through the belief that the configuration of the stars at the moment of one's birth will have any effect on their life and success. Ptolemy took this belief system to the next level by writing the "<strong>Tetrabiblos</strong>", the treatise on Astrology that transformed natal astronomy into something akin to a religion.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 19.</font></strong> The horoscope is the central part of natal astronomy, the identifying of the time of birth with the relationship to the movement of the stars that supposedly determines one's personality traits. If religion is the opium of the masses, Astrology is the opium of the ignoramuses. The zodiac, as mentioned in Rule 12, is divided into 12 <em>signs</em>, sections, each 30° long as part of the 360° celestial sphere.

	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 20.</font></strong> An individual's "sign" is their <strong>sun sign</strong>, which part of the zodiac the sun was in when they were born. However, because of precession (see Rule 15), the sky has been rotating over time, and in the 2000 years since the Tetrabiblos was written, the stars have shifted 1/12 the zodiac - about 1/2 of a sign. To stop themselves from allowing reason to infiltrate their minds, practioners of Astrology retain the position of stars as they were in the time of Ptolemy as their "sun sign", which makes even less sense than having the dates of the signs change over time. This speaks to the meaningless and pseudoscientific nature of Astrology as a whole, which, as an ancient spiritualistic practice, has had a remarkable lifespan past the Age of Enlightenment.<br><br><br>

      While Europe was going througn an anti-intellectual phase during the Middle Ages, there was a flowering of Astronomical discovery and progress during the <strong>Islamic Golden Age</strong>, which preserved and elaborated on the ideas of the Greeks. It was the end of the Dark Ages in Europe and the ushering in of the Renaissance that saw a revival in intellectual interest in sceintific, and importantly Astronomical, ideas in Europe. Copernicus embodied the spirit of European revival in interest in Astronomy (see below).
      <br><br><br>
      
      <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 21.</font></strong> <strong>Nicolaus Copernicus</strong> was a Polish astronomer who flourished during the early 1500s. He led the critical reappraisal of Ptolemy's ancient model of the Universe, which had stood as the dominant explanation of the cosmos for over a thousand years. He led the formation of the <strong>Heliocentric model</strong> of the solar system, which radically considered Earth itself to be a planet that orbited the sun, alongside all other planets. Additionally, he theorized that only the moon orbits the Earth.<br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/astronomy/img/earlyhelio.png"><img src="/astronomy/img/earlyhelio.png" alt="Copernicus developed a heliocentric plan of the solar system.

	    <span class="tiny"><em>Copernicus developed a heliocentric plan of the solar system. This system was published in the first edition of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium. Notice the word Sol for “Sun” in the middle.</em></span><br><br>
      
      As evident, he still assumed that the orbits of the planets would be uniformally circular. However, his ideas were revolutionary enough to provoke discussion across the scientific world, and the tenets of heliocentrism would eventually be popularly accepted over a century after his death. Controversiallly (as with everything he theorized), he explained the precession of the celestial sphere aas being the rotation of the Earth along its axis, while the sphere itself is stationary.
      <br><br><br>
      
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 22.</font></strong> Copernicus's masterpiece, <strong>De Revolutionibus</strong>, elaborates on Earth as one of six planets, and correctly lists the Planets in order of their proximity to the sun, and was able to deduce that the closer to the sun the planet, the greater the orbital speed. <!-- --> Furthermore, complexities like retrograde motion were explained through this new theory with much simpler explanations than Ptolemy. This theory conflicted with the thousands of years of established common sense: the greek/classical schools of thought, and the dogma pushed by the Catholic Church. <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 23.</font></strong> """"common sense"""" is the propaganda of human nature - half of the time it is fake news and ignorance, it is much more commmon than sensical. Aristotle believed that heavier objects will fall faster than lighter objects, and it was just so deducible from common sense that he did not even bother to test his theories before writing them down, and it was a long philosophical tradition to place high value on basic fundamental truths, 'axioms', which could be deduced by 'Basic' human thought, combined with """"divine revelation"""", DO NOT FALL FOR IT. The advancement of science is very easy to see as the progressive challenging of previously accepted axioms and theories - Classical Mechanics is useful for building the skills and understanding of general topics of Physics, but what happens to gravity on the Quantum Level? Relativity was born from the need to reconcile the Principle of Relativity with Electrodynamics, which had failed to be accomplished through the standard Newtonian model (see the failure of Emission Theory ([[[[)). Theory will only take you so far - dogmatic rationalism can be an impediment to scientific progress, think of how the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo. As soon as you theorize, you should theorize a complementary experiment to test its validity. <!--Using theory to explain experimental results is much cooler than using experiments to test theory - photoelectric effect--><br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 24.</font></strong> <strong>The scientific method</strong>, nonexistant during the time of Copernicus, was developed by <strong>Galileo Galileo</strong> during the 17th century. he contributed greatly to mexhanics, classical Physics of motion and forces on bodies. Galileo theorized the basics of Inertia, that rest is no more natural a state for a body than motion. He argued that a force is required not only to start an object moving from rest, but also for slowing down, stopping, speeding up, and changing direction in any form. Additionally, in studying <strong>acceleration</strong> (see <a href="/Physics/mechanics/velspaccel#Rule12">P. Rule 12</a>), he found that objects will accelerate uniformally as they free fall or roll down a ramp. These laws would be formulated in exact mathematical expressions. Most importantly, he adopted the heliocentric model of the universe in the 1590s and began lecturing on the topic. The church pushed back, decreeing that heliocentrism was "false and absurd" in 1616 and disavowing its defense.<br><br>
	    Galileo would drastically improve upon the telescope and its powers of magnification. He used this invention to observe the cosmos, beginning in 1609, and he discovered many distant stars too faint to be seen with the naked eye, and that the Mily Way across the night sky was made out of many stars as well. He found that Jupiter had its own moons, circling Jupiter at different orbit speeds, proving that centers of motion could themseves be in motion (a theory argued against by geocentrics). Venus proved to go through phases like the moon, showing it revolved around the sun. For these discoveries, Galileo was rewarded with a house arrest on the orders of the Catholic Church, who found his work heretical, and this would last until his death. In this confinement he would write on of his greatest masterpieces, the "<strong>Two New Sciences</strong>" which would form the foundations for modern Physics.
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 25.</font></strong> <strong>Tycho Brahe</strong> was a Danish astronomer who worked concurrent to Galileo, and produced a sound mathematical basis (along with Kepler) of Copernicus's Theory of Heliocentrism. He established an observatory on a Northe Sea Island, and he is said to be the last of the pre-telescopic observers in Europe. He took extremely detailed records of the positions of the Sun, Moon, and Planets for almost 20 years, the greatest collection of such data since Hipparchus. When he fled Denmark because of all the enemies he'd accumulated, he became the court Astronomer in Prague, where he enlisted the help of the young Astronomer Johannes Kepler in analyzing the data. <strong>Johannes Kepler</strong> was a German astronomer who served as Brahe' assistant in Prague. It was only after Brahe's death did Kepler gain access to the entirety of the records, which occupied him for the next 20 years. In this analysis, he developed three laws that dictate the motion of planets through Space, known as Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.
	   
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 26.</font></strong> <br><strong>Law 1 - The Orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</strong><br><br>
	   <u>Explanation</u>: The path of an object through space is called its orbit. Kepler assumed, at first, that the orbits of planets were cirlces, but doing so did not allow him to find orbits that were consistent with Brahe's observations. He discovered that the orbit of Mars was elliptical rather than circular. All of these shpaes are closed curves, belonging to a family of curves known as <strong>conic sections</strong>.<br>

	    <span class="tiny"><em>The circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola are all formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone. This is why such curves are called conic sections.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    See [[[[[ for more information about focus points (foci) and ellipses/hyperbola. The center of a circle, of course, is a special point: the distance from the center of a cicle to anywhere on the circle is always the same - that is the radius. in an ellipse there are TWO special points, they are called the <strong>foci</strong>, or the <strong>focus points</strong> of the ellipse. The sum of the distance from the focus points to any position on the ellipse is always the same:<br>

	    The foci will, of course, change their postion depending on the size/nature of the ellipse. The widest diameter of the ellipse is called its <strong>Major Axis</strong>, while half that distance, the distance from the center of the ellipse from end to end, is called the <strong>Semimajor Axis</strong>. The smallest diameter of the ellipse is the <strong>Minor Axis</strong> (of Symmetry), perpendicular to the Major Axis, and it has two semimajor axes at either side of the center as well:<br>

	    The semimajor axis of the orbit of Mars (also the planet's average distance from the Sun) is 228 million kilometers.<br><br>
	    The shape/roundness of an ellipse depends on how close together the two foci are, compared with the Major Axis. The ratio of the distance between the foci to the elngth of the major axis is called the <strong><u>eccentricity</u></strong> of the ellipse. If the eccentricity is zero, then the foci will be in the same spot and the ellipse will be a circle. Thus, in elliptical terms, a cricle is an ellipse of zero eccentricity with the semimajor-axis as the radius. <br /><br />
	    The greater the eccentricity, the more elongated the ellipse, up to a maximum eccentricity of 1.0, which is just a flat line. The size and shape of an ellipse are completely specificed by its semimajor axis and its eccentricity. Mars has an elliptical orbit of 0.1, wth the sun at one of the foci, the other being empty. This discovery was generalized by Kepler to apply to all orbits, with different eccentricities.
	    
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 27.</font></strong> <br><strong>Law 2 - A line segment joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</strong><br><br>
	   The second law deals with the orbital speed, or the speed with which each planet moves along its ellipse. Kepler determined that Mars moves faster as it comes closer to the Sun, and slows down as it pulls away from the Sun. Visualize an elastic band connecting a celestial body with the Sun. As the body gets farther from the sun, the band gets stretched, and thus moves slower until the band will pull it back to the sun. When it is closer to the sun, the band is not stretched as much and thus movs rapidly. Additionally, if you were to imagine the area sweeped in the ellipse (centered from the sun) by the orbit, then, given equal intervals of time, any two seweeped areas of the orbit will be equal.<br>

	   While a circular orbit would cause a planet to move at the same speed throughout its orbit, the orbits and differing speeds of the planets make it evident that their obits are elliptical.

	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 28.</font></strong> <strong>Law 3 - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semni-major axis of its orbit.</strong><br><br>
	   While the first two laws deal largely with the shape and speeds of a planet's orbit, there is yet to be a mathematical model for the spacing of the planets, how they ended up like that, known as the "Harmony of the Spheres". It was Kepler's 1619 discovery of a basic relationship relating the orbits of the planets to their relative distance from the sun that a mathematical model governing planetary spacing was formed. The Orbital Period P is the time it takes a planet to travel once around the Sun, and the semimajor axis of a planet's orbit is equivalent to its average distance from the sun. In mathematical terms, this law can be defined as the following:<br><br>
	   <strong>P² ∝ a³</strong><br><br>
	   
	   With regard to the Earth (and all other planets where years and AU are the given units), where P is measure in years and a is expressed in AU, the sides of the formula are not only proportional, but equal. The Third Law of Planetary Motion applies for all objects orbiting the sun, and enables the determination of an objects relative distance from the Sun based on how long the <strong>Orbital Period</strong> is. Since Mars has an orbital period of 1.88 years, the third law tells us that (1.88)² = a³, using years and AU as our units. Therefore, the semimajor axis of Mars has a length of <span style="white-space: nowrap">&#8731;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">3.53</span></span> AU, or 1.52 AU, thus orbiting farther from the Sun than Earth.
	   
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 29.</font></strong> :) Kepler's laws are highly qualitative, they only reflect rules of thumb that Kepler discerned about the planetary motion in the solar systems. The laws do not actually explain what forces of nature are causing the celestial body to act in this way. It would be <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> who would form the sound mathematical framework that explained the oservations and rules formulated by Galileo, Brahe, Kepler, and the rest. As a professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, Newton dedicated much of his time to pondering the cosmos and reality, and from this he developed special mathematical models/equations and laws to govern motion itself, the forces behind Kinematics. He wrote down his theories in a book called the <strong>Principia</strong>, in 1687, where he unleashed unto an unsuspecting public his three laws of motion:<br><br>
	   <strong><u>LAW 1</u>:  Every object will continue to be in a state of rest, or move at a constant speed in a straight line, until it is compelled to change by an outside force.</strong> The first law is just a restatement of one of Galileo's discoveries, called the <strong>Conservation of Momentum</strong> (see
	   <a href="/Physics/MechanicsFull3#MomentumBasics">P. Section VIII.II</a>). This law states that in the abscence of any outside influence, there is a measure of a body's motion, called its momentum, that remains unchanged. The first law is also oftentimes called the <strong>Law of Inertia</strong>, where Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in the state of motion (see the <a href="/Physics/mechanics/force#Inertia">physics reference</a>), akin to re-electing an incumbent forever. In other words, a stationary object will stay at rest while a moving object will keep moving until some force intervenes. 
	   
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 30.</font></strong> Momentum relies on three factors:
	   <ol>
      <li><strong>Speed</strong>, how fast an object moves (zero if stationary).

      </li><br>

      <li>The <strong>direction</strong> of the motion, whether using relative, cartesian, or cardinal directions.

      </li><br>

      <li>The <strong>mass</strong> of the body, a measure of the amount of matter in a body. 

      </li><br>

  </ol>
  
	   The speed (with only magnitude) and direction of motion can be combined as velocity (see <a href="/Physics/mechanics/velspaccel">Classical Physics Section I</a> for more in-depth) explanations and interpretations of velocity & speed). 20 kilometers per hour due South is in terms of Velocity, while 20 kilometers per hour by itsef is in terms of speed.<br><br> Momentum, referred to as variable p, can be expressed through the following equation: <span class="vecteur"><strong>p</strong></span> = m × <span class="vecteur"><strong>v</strong></span>, where m is the object's mass and v is the velocity at any point. It is difficult to see Momentum and the First Law of motion in action in the real world, because of how many forces are acting on a body at any one time, from Air Resistance to Electromagnetism. For example, while a ball rolling on the sidewalk will eventually be slowed down due to Rubbing Friction (see <a href="/Physics/MechanicsFull2#Rule58">P. Rule 58</a> and below), but if that ball was moving in space (the vacuum to which the idealized equations of kinematics are most applicable), the friction is so minute and insignificant that it would continue coasting through space forever. Thus, momentum can change only under the action of an outside force, such as gravity.
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 31.</font></strong> <strong><u>LAW 2</u>:  The change of motion of a body is proportional to, and in the direction of, the force acting on it.</strong> This law expresses force in terms of its ability to change momentum with time. A force, push or pull, has both direction and magnitude. When a force is applied to a body, the momentum changes in the direction of the applied force. This means that a force is required to change either the speed or the direction of a body, or both - to start it moving, to speed it up, to slow it down, to stop it, or to change its direction.<br><br>
	   The rate of change in an object's velocity is called acceleration, and the second law states that the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force being applied to it.<br><br>
	   For example: Imagine a table as a smooth, frictionless surface. If you were to push a book across it, it will speed up as long as you keep pushing it with a positive acceleration (or negative acceleration if you are pushing it backwards). The harder you push the book, the more it will speed up. How much an object will accelerated given a force is reliant on the mass of the object; if you pushed a pen on the table with the same force you pushed the book with, it would accelerate to a higher speed.
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 31.</font></strong> <strong><u>LAW 3</u>: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction (or: the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and act in opposite directions).</strong> This law generalizes the first law in a way that also defines mass. Thus, if there were to be a car system of multiple oblects, isolated from external forces, the first law would stipulate that the total momentum of the objects would remain constant. Any change of momentum in a system <u>must</u> be balanced by another change, equal in force and opposite in direction, so that the momentum of the entire system is not changed. In every situation, there is always a force pair governing the reactions between any two objects. When you fall from a tree, the force pair is you and the Earth, because the Earth is exerting the force of gravity attracting you to the Earth, while the Earth is accelerated by the student's pull. You do not notice the change in momentum of the Earth because of its huge mass, which measures the inertia of the object, the tendency of the object to resist acceleration. The recoil from hitting a ball with a baseball is further proof of the third law.

	   <strong><font color="#006400"><a href="#VolumeDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="VolumeDef">#</span></a> Volume</font></strong>: The measurement of how much Physical space an object occupies. Measured in cubic units, like cm³ or liters.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="#006400"><a href="#DensityDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="DensityDef">#</span></a> Density</font></strong>: Mass divided by volume. Common units include g/cm³.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 32.</font></strong> <strong>Angular Momentum</strong> is the measurement of the rotation of a body as it revolves around some fixed point, like a planet rotating around the Sun. Mathematically, the angular momentum of an object is the product of its mass, velocity, and distance from the fixed point (which isn't always the radius, as known from elliptical orbits). If these three values were to be constant, meaning that an object's motion takes places at a constant velocity at a fixed distance from the spin center, then the angular momentum is also constant.<br><br>
	   
	   Kepler's 2nd law is a result of the conservation of angular momentum. As a planet approaches the Sun on an elliptical orbit and the distance to the spin center decreases; the planet speeds up to conserve angular momentum. Similary, when the planet is farther from the sun, it moves slower. When you spin on a swivel chair at the park, when you have your arms outstretched, you move slower, but when you bring your arms inward, you speed up.
	   
	   <br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 33.</font></strong> Because the planets move in ellipses instead of straight lines, they must have a force bending their paths: <strong>gravity</strong>. The Earth's gravity extends to the moon, and in doing so produces the force required
to curve the Moon’s path from a straight line and keep it in its orbit. Furthermore, the attractive force of the Sun keeps all of the planets in their orbits.<br><br>

It was the Third law of motion that truly rocked the scientific world in its day, and it carried with it the implication that there was a Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere in space. This attraction both explains the falling of objects on Earth and the orbit of the planets. Thus, Newton formulated the law of Gravitational Attraction, establishing a proportionality between the gravitational force between two objects and the mass & distances of the objects:<br><br>

<strong>F<sub>g</sub> = (G × M<sub>1</sub> × M<sub>2</sub>) / R²</strong><br><br>

<strong>F<sub>g</sub></strong> = The Gravitational attraction between two bodies.<br>
<strong>G</strong> = The Universal Gravitational Constant, roughly 6.6743 x 10^-11.<br>
<strong>M<sub>1</sub></strong> = The Mass of the first object.<br>
<strong>M<sub>2</sub></strong> = The Mass of the second object.<br>
<strong>R</strong> = The distance between the two objects.<br><br>

Gravity is internal to the code of mass - it is a property that was specifically given a value in the source code of the Universe.<br><br><br>
