	  <article>
	    <p>These are my complete notes for Classical Astronomy, covering topics from throughout the progression of Astronomy, from the ancient beliefs of Aristotle and Ptolemy, to the more modern developments that have contributed to our currrent understanding of the cosmos, such as the revelations of Copernicus and Newton. <br><br>
	    <u><strong>NOTE</strong>: This section differs from other categories on the site and within Astronomy itself, because the Rules are written more narratively and are much less dense in their information. This is only the case for Classical Astronomy, which deals with many of the characters that existed throughout the early developments of Astronomy, like Ptolemy, Galileo, and Kepler.</u>
	    <br><br>I color-coded my notes according to their meaning - All numbered notes (which I call rules) are red, and include examples and the basis for understanding a topic. Definitions are written in green, and other important information (such as large-scale drawings that are better visualized than explained) was written in blue. All of this information is preserved on this page, with logical flow and breaks. I use ascii line drawings sparingly - If I can convey information or a graph using an image online, I will do so.<br><br>All of the knowledge present in these notes are filtered through my personal explanations for them, the result of my attempts to understand and study them from my classes. In the unlikely event there are any egregious errors, contact me at <a href="mailto:jdlacabe@gmail.com">jdlacabe@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	  <strong><font color="#006400">Astronomy</font></strong>: The study of the objects that use beyond planet Earth and the processes by which these objects interact with eachother. Organization of a history of the universe, from the Big Bang to the present. "Science is the progress report of the progress report probing of the secrets of the universe" - Charles Bailyn.
<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><font color="#006400">Light-Speed</font></strong>: The distance which light travels within one year. This is 9.46 × 10¹² kilometers per year. Light travels through the universe at this constant. The stars outside are only sending their light at lightspeed, so if one is 20 lightyears away, Earth will only see the stars as it looked 20 years previously. Therefore, we can learn about what happened billions of years ago, at the dawn of the universe, by looking at stars farther away.
<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><font color="#006400">Astronomical Units</font></strong>: The distance between the Sun and the Earth. Light travels from the sun over 8 minutes to the Earth. 1 year is the length of time it takes the Earth to rotate around the Sun. Our velocity with respect to Earth is zero, but with respect to the Sun, we're moving 110,000 kilometers per second due to the Earth's orbit. This is <a href="/Physics/mechanics/range">Relative Motion & Velocity</a>, which is mathematically elaborated on in Classical Physics.
<br><br><br>
	  
	 

	    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 1.</font></strong> There are eight planets that orbit around the sun along with bunches of other bodies like moons, dwarf planets, and whatever. These make up the solar system we live in. <strong>Planets</strong> are celestial bodies of significant size that orbits a star. If the planet consistently produces its own light, it is a star.<br><br>

	    The Sun being our local star, and stars themselves are basically just enormous balls of bglowing gas which generate energy by internal nuclear reactions.
	    <br><br><br>
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 2.</font></strong> All of the stars visible out in the sky are a part of the <strong>Mily Way Galaxy</strong> - there are hundreds of billions of more stars in our galaxy, and hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. The Milky Way Galaxy is like a giant disk with a small ball in the middle. The space between the stars is actually not completely empty: there is a sparse distribution of gas intermixed with tiny particles called <strong>interstellar dust</strong>. The gas and dust will collect into huge clouds in the galaxy, which will form the raw material for future star generations. This interstellar dust is extremely sparse, however, so sparse still serves as a great vacuum. Built-up dust is the space smog, blocking the view of more distant regions of the galaxy to Earth.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 3.</font></strong> Because of experimental/observational evidence proving that there is some unknown material exerting gravitational force upon space objects, we know there is some "<strong>Dark Matter</strong>" that cannot be directly observed interfering with everything.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 4.</font></strong> While many solar systems only have on star (like ours), many systems are <strong>double</strong> or <strong>triple systems</strong>, with 2, 3, or more stars revolving around each other. Several places in the galaxy have so many stars they are called <strong>star clusters</strong>.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 5.</font></strong> All stars die after running out of <u>fuel</u>, because stars can only produce energy as they do while they have some fuel source. The Sun, for example, uses <strong>nuclear fusion</strong> to create fuel, converting hydrogen into helium, which releases energy in the form of light and heat. When stars die, they explode and their star dust is fed back into the universe for reuse.<br><br><br>
	   
	   <strong><font color="#006400">Constellation</font></strong>: The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations">88 patches of sky</a> which humans have deliminated to simplify observations. For example: the <strong>Saggitarius Dwarf Galaxy</strong> is in the direction of the Saggitarius constellation.
<br><br><br>
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 6.</font></strong> The Milky Way Galaxy has many orbiting <strong>satellite galaxies</strong> that will eventually be incorporated/subsumed by the Milky Way Galaxy itself, such as the <strong>Magellanic Clouds</strong> and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. The nearest non-satellite galaxy to the Milky Way is the <strong>Andromeda Galaxy</strong> (of the Andromeda Constellation), and these two galaxies, along with 50 others nearvy, are called the <strong>Local Group</strong>, our local galaxy cluster. Most galaxies occur in cluster.<br><br><br>


    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 7.</font></strong> Some galaxy clusters themselves from into larger groups, called <strong>superclusters</strong>. The Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster, 110 million lightyears across. Farther away, there are <strong>quasars</strong>, the especially brilliant centers of galaxies which glow from an extremely energetic process. Normally, at the distance where we see quasars, galaxies are too dim to see, but because quasars have an energy produced by a gas heated to a temperature of millions of degrees as it gravitates toward a massive black hole and swirls around it, quasars are bright enough to be the most distant objects we can see in the expanses of space. The quasars are 10 billion plus light-years away, and thus showing us 10 billion years into the past. Beyond these quasars, astronomers detected the feeble afterglow of the Big Bang, detected from all directions in space.<br><br><br>
    
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 8.</font></strong> While the universe is very large, it is also very sparse. In the interstellar gas of the galaxy, there is on average one atom per cubic centimeter, while in <strong>intergalactic space</strong> (much sparser than our galaxy), that number drops to one atom per cubic meter of space.<br><br><br>
    
    
    <strong><font color="red">A. Rule 9.</font></strong> <strong>Summary of the Atomic Level of Matter:</strong><br><br>
The smallest part of any matter (anything more complex than mono-atomic structures) are the molecules, particles that are the smallest part of the matter that retains its chemical properties. Water, for example, has the molecule H<sub>2</sub>O, three atoms bonded together. Molecules are always built of atoms, the smallest division of an element that can be identified as that element. 
<br><br>There are over 100 elements that occur in nature, but most are rare, and only a few occur with any real frequency, known as the <strong>“Cosmically Abundant”</strong> elements. Listed in descending frequency, they are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>Hydrogen </li>
<li>Helium </li>
<li>Carbon </li>
<li>Nitrogen </li>
<li>Oxygen </li>
<li>Neon </li>
<li>Magnesium </li>
<li>Silicon </li>
<li>Sulfur </li>
<li>Iron </li>
</ol>

Atoms consist of a central, positively charged <strong>nucleus</strong> surrounded by negatively charged <strong>electrons</strong>. The densest part of the atom is in the nucleus (composed of positive protons and neutral neutrons) while the majority of the mass is in the electron cloud around the nucleus. Elements are defined by the number of <strong>protons</strong> in its atoms. The distance between the nucleus to the electrons is 100K times that of the diameter of the nucleus itself. Thus, solid matter is mostly empty space, and atoms are much emptier than the solar system.

<strong><font color="#006400">Zenith</font></strong>: The point in the 'space dome' directly above you, from your perspective.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Horizon</font></strong>: The point where the space dome meets the Earth. In a flat land, the horizon would be seens as a circle around you.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Sphere</font></strong>: The ancient Greek view of the world as a sphere, of which the outermost shell had stars embedded like sky decorations.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Axis</font></strong>: The central line of the Earth going from the North Pole through the Earth to the South Pole. The Earth rotates on its axis counterclockwise, from the perspective of the Northern direction.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Pole</font></strong>: If we extend the Earth's axis into space, we find that there is now a north and south celestial pole that the stars rotate around:<br>

	    <span class="tiny"><em>The trails of the stars over many nights as a result of the rotation of the Earth around the celestial pole.</em></span><br><br>
<br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Celestial Equator</font></strong>: As an extension of the celestial poles, we can imgine Earth's equator stretching off into space.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 10.</font></strong> Way back when, everyone thought the universe revolved around the Earth, known as the geocentric model of the universe. This is ignorant and wrong. This idea was developed for more reasons than sheer human-centrism, however: the sun was about 1° to the east each day, relative to the stars. It takes 1 year for the sun to make a complete circle. This path is elliptic - the Sub rises 4 minutes later each day with respect to the stars. During the day, sunlight is scattered by the molecules of our atmosphere, filling our sky with light and hiding the stars above the horizon. The elliptic is not along the celestial equator (see below), but rather inclined to it at an angle of 23.5°, because Earth's axis of rotation is tilted by 23.5°. Other planets are so tilted that they orbit the sun on their side. This tilt is why the sun moves north and south in the sky as the seasons change.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 11.</font></strong> North of the equator, the north celestial pole will appear above the northern horizon at an angle equal to one's latitude - In San Francisco, 38°N, the north celestial pole is 38° above the northern horizon. The south celestial pole is thus 38° below the southern horizon, and furthermore at 38° South the southern celestial pole will be 38° above the horizon. The part of the sky however many degrees from the pole (in this case, 38°) will seem to never set, known as the <strong>circumpolar zone</strong>. There is a particular star right at the Earth's north celesetial pole that seems to move minimally during the daily rotations of the heavens: this is <strong>Polaris</strong>, the North Star.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 12.</font></strong> Apart from the sun, the other planets change their positions slightly everyday. They have their own rotational patterns, rising and setting and what not. The Greeks differentiated these bodies from the rest of the "fixed stars" by calling them planets, or wanderers. The moon has the fastest planetary motion, since it moves 12° per day. All of the planets have their paths close to the elliptic path of the sun, because the paths of the planets around the sun are all almost in exactly the same plane, like circles on a paper along with the Earth. Each of the major celestial bodies are found with an 18°-wide belt, centered on the Sun's elliptic path, known as the <strong>zodiac</strong>. The motions of the planets, as seen from Earth, are somewhat obfuscated by the movement of Earth, making the process rather complex.

<strong><font color="#006400">Astronomy</font></strong>: The science of the universe cosmology. The art of interpreting the universe.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="#006400">Cosmology</font></strong>: The science of the cosmos, the human conceptualization and invention of understanding for the cosmos. The Mayans and Ancient Britons used calendar systems to record astronomical observations, such as the Mayan calendar and Stonehenge. A bunch of cultures developed 365 day calendars, like the Egyptians and Chinese needed for things like the timing of the flooding of the Nile River.
<br><br><br>


<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 13.</font></strong> Aristotle knew everything about Astronomy back in the day, from 384-322 B.C. - he wrote of how the moon's phases are due to the differing portions that are sunlit as the months go by. He knew the sun was farther away due to the solar eclipses, and that the Earth was spherical due to the shadow on the moon never being indicative of a disk (which would be a straight line across). He, and everyone else at the time, were also convinced that the Universe was revolving around the Earth, because the closer objects in the sky seem to move on a more still distance backdrop. This is called <strong>Parallax</strong>, the shift in direction of an object due to the perspective and motion of the observer. The perceived shift in direction of stars due to the Earth's orbital motion is called stellar parallax, and because it is practically imperceptible in more distance objects (believed to be closer due to their brightness) made only two possibilities clears to the Greeks:<br><br>

1. The Earth is not moving.<br>
2. The stars are so far away that the Parallax shift is extremely small, much like how far-away mountains do not seem to move when you are moving far away from them.<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 14.</font></strong> Flat Earth is an ignoramus ideology for the following reasons: if you were to view a ship sailing across the horizon, you would find that it does not shrink and get smaller. The curvature of the Earth will interfere with your view of the ship, and the hull of the ship will disappear over the horizon before the mast does<br><br>
Secondly, if we were to assume the Earth is a disk, know would it be possible for it to be night and day on different parts of the Earth. The nature of a disk makes it so when the sun is facing it, even if the disk is turned a little, it will be day. 
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 15.</font></strong> Geometric determination of the size of the Earth.<br><br>
Because the sun is so far away, if everyone on Earth were to point at the Sun when it is visible (the entire enlightened side of the Earth), each arm would be parallel:<br><br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/astronomy/img/pointingtosun.png"><img src="/astronomy/img/pointingtosun.png" alt="The more distant an object, the closer to parallel the rays of light coming from it." width=60%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>The more distant an object, the closer to parallel the rays of light coming from it.</em></span><br><br>
 <strong>Eratosthenes</strong> found that the bottom of a well in Syrene, Egypt would be perfectly enlightened by the sun at noon on the first day of Summer. At noon of the first of Summer in Alexandria, he found that the sun was not directly overhead, but in fact off by a few degrees based on the shadow of a column. Therefore, in Alexandria the sun was roughly 7° off of what is was in Syrene. This being 1/50th of the 360° of the assumed sphere, he multiplied the distance from Syrene to Alexandria by 50 and found a rough estimate of the circumference fo the Earth.
<br><br><br>

<strong><font color="red">A. Rule 16.</font></strong> Hipparchus was even more hardcore in his devotion to Astronomical truth than old Eratosthenes. He catalogued the sky into a system of coordinates and brightness - the position of objects in the sky (and their charges) were catalogued in a primitive celestial latitude and longitude system, and he divided the sky into different apparent magnitudes according to their brightness - The brightest stars were of the first magnitude, for example<br><br><br>
