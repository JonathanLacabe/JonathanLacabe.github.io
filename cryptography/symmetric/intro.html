      The classic form of Cryptography - two parties hold a secret key, enabling one party to encrypt a message and the other party to decrypt it. Thus, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.<br><br>
      Until 1976, this was the only form of cryptography in existence, and describes the basic nature of all historical ciphers (such as the shift/caesar cipher and affine cipher) and Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers, and DES & AES. Hash functions are somewhat similar to symmetric algorithms, though they can be considered an independent, <em>third</em> type of Cryptographic algorithm.

      The new cryptography, which all modern cryptosystems and what much of the infrastructure of the Internet, is based on. Invented by the Diffie-Hellman team in 1976, Public-Key Cryptography functions by having each party have <strong>TWO</strong> keys, a private key and a public key. <br><br>For more detail on how these algorithms work, see the "Public-Key Cryptography" Section ([[[[[), but know they are used in a variety of fashions: digital signatures, key establishment/management, and more!

        </strong> <strong>Symmetric Cryptosystem</strong>:
	  
	  
	    <br><br>The ancient problem presents itself: How can two parties communicate over an <strong>insecure channel</strong> (an 'open channel') without having their communications be intercepted by a third-party?<br><br>

      Say <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> connect through the internet (which is an open channel due to the potential of package rerouting/interception) and transfer data. An opponent, <strong>Oscar</strong>, can read their communications by intercepting the data before it reaches Bob.<br><br>

	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png"><img src="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png" alt="A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar." width=90%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    To stop Oscar from reading the message, an encryption algorithm can be established, converting the plaintext message (x) into a ciphertext message (y), and then sending it through the insecure channel. Oscar would only see a stream of random characters/bits as a result of the encryption. Bob, using a decryption function, would convert the ciphertext back into plaintext, thus completing the data transfer without interception.<br><br>

      In order for Bob to not simply decrypt the ciphertext immediately using the decryption function (which should be made publicly available - see Rule 3), a <strong>Key</strong> only known to Alice and Bob (sent through a secure, impenetrable channel) must be used as a parameter in both the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>The key must be inputted into the encryption function to influence the manner in which the plaintext is encrypted into cyphertext. Thus, only with the key will Bob be able to decrypt the Ciphertext. Oscar, who doesn't know the key, will be unable to decrypt the message, even if the decryption algorithm is public.<br><br>

	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing a symmetric cryptosystem, complete with a key sent through a secure channel and encryption/decryption functions.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    <strong>x</strong> = Plaintext message - the unadulterated, original content of the message.<br><br>

      <strong>y</strong> = Ciphertext, which looks like scrambled characters to an interceptor like Oscar.<br><br>
      
      <strong>e</strong> = Encryption function, a mathematical formula that converts x into y.<br><bR>
      
      <strong>d</strong> = Decryption function, a mathematical formula that converts y into x.<br><br>
      
      <strong>K</strong> = The Key fed into the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>
      	    
      <strong>|K|, 𝒦</strong> = Keyspace, the total number of possible keys in a cryptosystem. This matters significantly with regard to brute-force Cryptanalysis (see Rule 5). The keyspace corresponds to the <strong>key size</strong>/<strong>key length</strong> of the algorithm: If it produces a 168-bit key (see Rule [[[[), then there are 2^168 possible keys.

      </strong> Keeping the encryption/decryption algorithms 'e' and 'd' secret, preventing their cryptanalysis by the enemy (known as <strong>Security by Obscurity</strong>), was standard procedure for the ~4000 year history of Cryptography prior to the discovery of public-key Cryptography. However, <strong>the only way of ensuring the security of the algorithms is to make them public so it can be analyzed by cryptanalysts</strong>.<br><br>


        This is the central principle of a foundational law in Cryptography, postulated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs:<br><br><br>
        
        <strong>Kerckhoffs' Principle</strong>:<br><br>
        <em>"A cryptosystem should be secure even if the attacker</em> (Oscar)<em> knows all the details of the system, with the exception of the secret key."</em><br><br><br>

        Thus, all parties intercepting/eavesdropping will be unable to read or manipulate the message, even if they control any of the base stations the message goes through.<br><br>

        </strong> There are multitudes of cryptanalysis techniques, and the crucial law is that if just one attack works, then the entire cryptosystem crumbles and fails. While a substitution cipher (see Rule 7) may be impenetrable to a brute-force attack (with its 2^88 keyspace), it collapses against letter frequency analysis.<br><br>
        
          In order for a cryptosystem to be considered secure, it must be resistant against every single type of attack. An attacker always looks for the weakest link in the cryptosystem. Thus, in addition to strong algorithms, safeguards against social engineering and implementation attacks must be instituted.

Extraction of the key through '<strong>side-channel analysis</strong>'. By observing the behavior of the implementation of the cryptosystem in an IC or software, it is possible to deduce important relation relating to the key.<br><br>

For example: By looking at the electrical power consumption or electromagnetic radiation of a CPU running a cryptographic algorithm, a signal processing technique can be used to recover the key. The run time behavior can also indicate information regarding the key, which is why many cryptographers ensure constant run times in embedded cryptosystems.<br><br>
These attacks are most relevant when the attacker has physical access to a piece of hardware running the cryptosystem, such as a credit card.

        </strong> <strong>Classical Attack #1: Brute-Force Attack/Exhaustive Key search</strong>:<br><br>

<strong><u>Mathematical Definition</u></strong>:<br><br>

<em>Let (x, y) denote the pair of plaintext and ciphertext, and let K = {k<sub>1</sub> ,..., k<sub>κ</sub> } be the key space of all possible keys k<sub>i</sub>. A brute-force attack now checks for every k<sub>i</sub> ∈ K whether d<sub>k<sub>i</sub></sub> == x.<br><br>

If the equality holds, a possible correct key is found; if not, proceed with the next key.
</em>
<br><br><br>

<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>

The testing of all possible keys in a given keyspace with the decryption function, to see if they produce the plaintext. This is akin to thinking of the cryptosystem as a black box, in which the only significant factor to decoding an encrypted message is the number of possible keys the message could have been created with. 
<br><br>
As of 2010 (very recent), the largest keyspace that can be searched in a relatively reasonable amount of time is 2^60. However, not all key bits are created equally: a 128-bit symmetric key provides roughly the same security as a 3072-bit RSA (asymmetric algorithm) key.<br><br>

The intelligent counterpart to 'brute'-force, Analytical Attacks examine the internal characteristics of the encryption function and pick apart weaknesses in the function that could enable reconstruction of the plaintext message, such as Letter Frequency Analysis (for the Substitution Cipher) and Differential Cryptanalysis (for Block and Stream Ciphers).<br><br>

<strong><a href="#CiphertextOnlyDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="CiphertextOnlyDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Ciphertext-only Attack</font></strong>: An attack in which the adversary only has knows the ciphertext.
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#KnownPlaintextDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="KnownPlaintextDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Known-plaintext Attack</font></strong>: In addition to the ciphertext, the adversary also knows some pieces of the plaintext (e.g., header information of an encrypted file or email).
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#ChosenPlaintextDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ChosenPlaintextDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Chosen-plaintext Attack</font></strong>: An attack in which the adversary can choose the plaintext that is being encrypted and also has access to the corresponding ciphertext, found through possession of the decryption function (whether aware of its internal workings or not).
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#ChosenCiphertextDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ChosenCiphertextDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Chosen-ciphertext Attack</font></strong>: An attack in which the adversary can choose ciphertexts and obtain the corresponding plaintexts, the goal being (typically) to recover the secret key.
