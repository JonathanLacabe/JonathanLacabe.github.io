<strong><a href="#SymmetricAlgDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="SymmetricAlgDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Symmetric Algorithms</font></strong>: The classic form of Cryptography - two parties hold a secret key, enabling one party to encrypt a message and the other party to decrypt it. Until 1976, this was the only form of cryptography in existence, and describes the basic nature of all historical ciphers (such as the shift/caesar cipher and affine cipher) and Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers, and DES & AES. Hash functions are somewhat similar to symmetric algorithms, though they can be considered an independent, <em>third</em> type of Cryptographic algorithm.

	  <strong><a href="#Rule2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule2">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 2.</font></strong> Symmetric Cryptography
	  
	  
	  <br><br>The ancient problem presents itself: How can two parties communicate over an <strong>insecure channel</strong> (an 'open channel') without having their communications be intercepted by a third-party?<br><br>

Say <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> connect through the internet (which is an open channel due to the potential of package rerouting/interception) and transfer data. An opponent, <strong>Oscar</strong>, can read their communications by intercepting the data before it reaches Bob.<br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png"><img src="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png" alt="A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar." width=90%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    To stop Oscar from reading the message, an encryption algorithm can be established, converting the plaintext message (x) into a ciphertext message (y), and then sending it through the insecure channel. Oscar would only see a stream of random characters/bits as a result of the encryption. Bob, using a decryption function, would convert the ciphertext back into plaintext, thus completing the data transfer without interception.<br><br>

In order for Bob to not simply decrypt the ciphertext immediately using the decryption function (which should be public for reasons outlined in Rule 3), a <strong>Key</strong> only known to Alice and Bob (sent through a secure, impenetrable channel) must be used as a parameter in both the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>The key must be inputted into the encryption function to influence the manner in which the plaintext is encrypted into cyphertext. Thus, only with the key will Bob be able to decrypt the Ciphertext. Oscar, who doesn't know the key, will be unable to decrypt the message, even if the decryption algorithm is public.<br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/cryptography/img/AliceBobSecure.png"><img src="/cryptography/img/AliceBobSecure.png" alt="A diagram showcasing a symmetric cryptosystem, complete with a key sent through a secure channel and encryption/decryption functions." width=90%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing a symmetric cryptosystem, complete with a key sent through a secure channel and encryption/decryption functions.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    <strong>x</strong> = Plaintext message - the unadulterated, original content of the message.<br><br>

<strong>y</strong> = Ciphertext, which looks like scrambled characters to an interceptor like Oscar.<br><br>

<strong>e</strong> = Encryption function, a mathematical formula that converts x into y.<br><bR>

<strong>d</strong> = Decryption function, a mathematical formula that converts y into x.<br><br>

<strong>K</strong> = The Key fed into the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>
	    
<strong>|K|, 𝒦</strong> = Keyspace, the total number of possible keys in a cryptosystem. This matters significantly with regard to brute-force Cryptanalysis (see Rule 5). The keyspace corresponds to the <strong>key size</strong>/<strong>key length</strong> of the algorithm: If it produces a 168-bit key (see Rule [[[[), then there are 2^168 possible keys.
	    
	    
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#Rule3"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule3">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 3.</font></strong> Keeping the encryption/decryption algorithms 'e' and 'd' secret, preventing their cryptanalysis by the enemy (known as <strong>Security by Obscurity</strong>), was standard procedure for the ~4000 year history of Cryptography prior to the discovery of public-key Cryptography. However, <strong>the only way of ensuring the security of the algorithms is to make them public so it can be analyzed by cryptanalysts</strong>.<br><br>


This is the central principle of a foundational law in Cryptography, postulated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs:<br><br><br>

<strong>Kerckhoffs' Principle</strong>:<br><br>
<em>"A cryptosystem should be secure even if the attacker</em> (Oscar)<em> knows all the details of the system, with the exception of the secret key."</em><br><br><br>


In Practice: Never use an untested Crypto algorithm! Furthermore, never roll your own crypto!
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#EndToEndDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="EndToEndDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">End-Eo-End Encryption (E2EE)</font></strong>: A system of encryption widely used in modern communication services (like internet messaging sites), in which all data sent from Alice to Bob (party #1 to party #2) is never decrypted at any point along its route until it reaches Bob. <br><br>
Thus, all parties intercepting/eavesdropping will be unable to read or manipulate the message, even if they control any of the base stations the message goes through.<br><br>

<strong><a href="#Rule4"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule4">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 4.</font></strong> There are multitudes of cryptanalysis techniques, and the crucial law is that if just one attack works, then the entire cryptosystem crumbles and fails. While a substitution cipher (Rule 7) may be impenetrable to a brute-force attack (with its 2^88 keyspace), it collapses against letter frequency analysis.<br><br>
In order for a cryptosystem to be considered secure, it must be resistant against every single type of attack. An attacker always looks for the weakest link in the cryptosystem. Thus, in addition to strong algorithms, safeguards against social engineering and implementation attacks must be instituted.<br><br><br>

The run time behavior can also indicate information regarding the key, which is why many cryptographers ensure constant run times in embedded cryptosystems.<br><br>

<strong><a href="#Rule5"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule5">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 5.</font></strong> <strong>Classical Attack #1: Brute-Force Attack/Exhaustive Key search</strong>:<br><br>

<strong><u>Mathematical Definition</u></strong>:<br><br>

<em>Let (x, y) denote the pair of plaintext and ciphertext, and let K = {k<sub>1</sub> ,..., k<sub>κ</sub> } be the key space of all possible keys k<sub>i</sub>. A brute-force attack now checks for every k<sub>i</sub> ∈ K whether d<sub>k<sub>i</sub></sub> == x.<br><br>

If the equality holds, a possible correct key is found; if not, proceed with the next key.
</em>
<br><br><br>

<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>

The testing of all possible keys in a given keyspace with the decryption function, to see if they produce the plaintext. This is akin to thinking of the cryptosystem as a black box, in which the only significant factor to decoding an encrypted message is the number of possible keys the message could have been created with. 
<br><br>
As of 2010 (very recent), the largest keyspace that can be searched in a relatively reasonable amount of time is 2^60. However, not all key bits are created equally: a 128-bit symmetric key provides roughly the same security as a 3072-bit RSA (asymmetric algorithm) key.<br><br>

<strong><a href="#MooresLawDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="MooresLawDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Moore’s Law</font></strong>: The computing power of the strongest computers (e.g., the number of transistors in an integrated circuit) will double every 18-24 months while the price will remain constant. This means that computing power, growing exponentially over time, will continually pose more and more of a threat to modern cryptographic systems and to antiquated ones still in use, as it becomes cheaper and faster to break them.

<strong><a href="#Rule6"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule6">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 6.</font></strong> <strong>Classical Attack #2: Analytical Attacks</strong>:<br><br>

The intelligent counterpart to 'brute'-force, Analytical Attacks examine the internal characteristics of the encryption function and pick apart weaknesses in the function that could enable reconstruction of the plaintext message, such as Letter Frequency Analysis (for the Substitution Cipher) and Differential Cryptanalysis (for Block and Stream Ciphers).<br><br>
There is no 'equation' for Analytical Attacks, because they are specific and unique to every cryptosystem (though some common characteristics can emerge between similar cryptosystems).

	    <strong>Substitution Cipher</strong><br><br>
A historical cipher, operating purely on letters, in which every plaintext letter is replaced by a fixed ciphertext letter. It is just scrambling the letters, nothing more.<br><br>

The Keyspace is 26!, or 2^88, as each plaintext letter that maps to a ciphertext letter decreases the remaining number of possible letters. Thus, a brute-force attack would be out of the question for modern computers.<br><br>

Since the different letters of the English alphabet have different frequencies, and these frequencies are preserved even after scrambling (just different letters will <em>have</em> the frequencies), <strong>Letter Frequency Analysis</strong> can be conducted as an attack on the substitution cipher, making it rather simple.<br><br>

This is an example of a cipher/algorithm in which an Analytical Attack is most effective.

<strong><u>Mathematical Definition</u></strong>:<br><br>
<em>(a, r, m) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><br>
m > 0<br><br>
If <strong>m|(a − r)</strong>, then <strong>a ≡ r mod m</strong>
</em><BR><BR><br>
<strong>ℤ</strong> = The set of all integers.<br>
<strong>a</strong> = The chosen number.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The remainder.<br>
<strong>m</strong> = The modulus, the highest possible number in the set.<br>
<strong>'mod'</strong> = The modulus/remainder operator, which represents the usage of modular arithmetic, with all numbers represented by their remainder with respect to m.
<br><br><br>

<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>

Since the bulk of cryptographic computations are performed in finite sets, special mathematical tools are needed. In particular, Modular Arithmetic is the basis for all modern cryptosystems, and many historical ones as well.<br><br>

Modular arithmetic is a system of simplifying a number in terms of a given <strong>modulus</strong>, the highest number in a set. Any number greater than the modulus is rewritten using the <strong>modulus operator</strong> (or remainder operator, see below), in effect 'wrapping' the number around the modulus, with respect to the difference between the number and any multiple of the modulus, known as the <em>remainder</em>.<br><br>

The <em>preferred</em> multiple for finding the remainder (indeed, the exact one that would be found by division (see two paragraphs below)) is the greatest one lower than the number, but any will work - see Rule 10, Equivalence Classes.<br><br>
For example, with a modulus of 12, 61 would be represented as 1 mod 12.<br><br>

The process of finding the modular equivalent of a number is simple: divide the chosen number by the modulus, and find the remainder. The remainder will then be the coefficient in front of the modulus operator. All numbers smaller than the modulus are rendered ordinarily, without the mod operator.

	  To find the remainder when m and a are large, burdensome numbers, there is an exact, algorithmic definition:<br><br><br>

<strong><u>Mathematical Definition</u></strong>:<br><br>
<em>
(a, m) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><br>
0 ≤ r &lt; m <br><br>
a = q × m + r<br>
Thus, a - r = q × m<br><br>
<strong>m|(a − r)</strong>
</em><BR><br><Br>

<strong>ℤ</strong> = The set of all integers.<br>
<strong>a</strong> = The chosen number.<br>
<strong>q</strong> = The quotient, which produces a multiple of the modulus.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The remainder.<br>
<strong>m</strong> = The modulus, the highest possible number in the set.<BR><br>
The final equation is precisely the same as what was discovered before, and q is not involved whatsoever - all that matters is the remainder.
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule10"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule10">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 10.</font></strong> <strong>Equivalence Classes</strong>:<br><br>

While 12 ≡ 3 mod 9, it is equally true that 12 ≡ 21 mod 9, and that 12 ≡ -6 mod 9. This is because, while the remainders may not exactly be the difference between 'a' (12) and the <u>highest</u> multiple of m lesser than a (9), they all still return true in the formula of Rule 8:<br><br>

12 ≡ 3 mod 9, 3 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−3)<br>
12 ≡ 21 mod 9, 21 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−21)<br>
12 ≡ −6 mod 9, −6 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−(−6))<br><br>

The set of all values that behave 'equivalently' for a particular modulus, in that they can be simplified down to the smallest possible positive number for r, form what is known as an <strong>Equivalence Class</strong>, an infinite set/series of values.<br><br>

For 3 mod 9, the equivalence class of r values is an infinite set, a partial series of which is as follows:<br>
{..., -24, -15, -6, 3, 12, 21, 30, ...}<br><br>

If any of these values were to be substituted in for r (3) in 3 mod 9, it would be equivalent, the same value, because of the mod operator.<br><br>

Note: There are 'm' equivalence classes for each possible remainder (0 through m-1), which collectively contain all possible integers. The difference between any two neighboring values in an equivalence class will be the modulus, as shown above.
	  
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule11"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule11">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 11.</font></strong> <strong>Modular Reduction</strong>:<br><br>
	  Because any value in an equivalence class acts the same with regard to the mod operator of a given modulus, then substitutions in mathematical operations that use the modulus operator can be performed, simplifying them.<br><br>

Take (13 × 16) - 8, with modulus 5. While the full number can be computed (200) and an answer derived from there (0 mod 5), that is lame and time-consuming. A much cooler, faster, 21st century means of solving the problem is to substitute in for each term the simplest member of their respective equivalence classes:<br><br>

13 mod 5 has a remainder of 3, and so 3 is the simplest term.<br>
16 mod 5 has a remainder of 1, and so 1 is the simplest term.<br>
8 mod 5 has a remainder of 3, and so 3 is the simplest term.<br><br>

Therefore, the same calculation can be performed with simply (3 × 1) - 3, which returns 0 mod 5, the same answer as before, but found much easier-ly.<br><br><br>

Note that this substitution trick does <u>not</u> equally extend to all mathematical operations. Exponentials, for example, cannot be simplified with the modulus:<br><br>
For the problem 3⁸ mod 7, the exponent '8' cannot be simplfied down to 1 mod 7, and the entire problem to 3 mod 7. Exponents simply cannot have the substitution performed.<br><br>
For all exponentials, simplification into smaller components (using the 2nd Holy Property of Exponents, Math Rule 66 ([[[[[)) must be performed to simplify. For ex.: 3⁸ = (3²)⁴ = (9)⁴ = (2)⁴ = 16 mod 7 = <strong>2 mod 7</strong>, which is the answer.<br><br><br>

Modular Arithmetic can be defined in the form of an integer ring:<br><br><br>
<em>
The integer ring <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> consists of the following characteristics:<br><br>
<strong>1.</strong> The set <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> = {0, 1, ..., m-1}<br><br>
<strong>2.</strong> Two arithmetic operators, "+" and "×", hold for all (a, b, c, d) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>i)</strong>&nbsp; a + b ≡ c mod m<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ii)</strong> a × b ≡ d mod m

There are many overshadowing rules that every ring has to fulfill, seen in the section "RULES OF THE RING" below.

  These following rules hold true for all integer rings in general, not just modular arithmetic.<br><br>
  <ol>

<li> The ring should be closed: if any two numbers from the set are multiplied or added together, the result must be in the ring. This is ensured by the modulus operator.</li><br>

<li> Addition and multiplication are associative properties: For all (a, b, c) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.</li><br><br>

<strong>Addition:</strong><br><br><br>

<li> Addition is commutative for all (a, b) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>: a + b = b + a.</li>
<br>

<li>There is an <strong>additive neutral element</strong>, 0. For all elements a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, it holds that <strong>a + 0 ≡ a mod m</strong>.</li>
<br>
<!--ajj- backpack playing in my head all day-->

<li>The <strong>additive inverse</strong> always exists: for any element a in the ring, there is always a negative element '-a' such that <strong>a + (-a) ≡ 0 mod m</strong>, the neutral element.</li>
<br><br>

<strong>Multiplication</strong>:<br><br><br>

<li>There is a <strong>multiplicative neutral element</strong>, 1: For all elements a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, it holds that <strong>a × 1 ≡ a mod m.</strong></li><br>

<li>The <strong>Multiplicative Inverse</strong> exists only for <u>some</u> elements: For a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong>, the inverse a⁻¹ is defined such that <strong>a × a⁻¹ ≡ 1 mod m</strong>. The nature of most inverses and the reasons for their occasional nonexistence are outlined in Rules 14 & 15.<br><br>
If there exists an inverse for a, then, a rare usage of division in the modular ring becomes possible: the element a⁻¹ can be divided by, as <strong>b/a ≡ b × a⁻¹ mod m</strong>.</li>
<br>


<li> The distributive property holds for all ring operations. For all (a, b, c) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).</li>

</ol>

<br><br>
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule14"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule14">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 14.</font></strong> To determine if an inverse exists for a specific 'a' of a specific modulus, simply find the gcd (Greatest Common Divisor) of the two values:
<br><br>

If <strong>gcd(a, m) = 1</strong>, then there exists a⁻¹, and a & m are said to be "<strong>relatively prime</strong>", or "<strong>coprime</strong>".<br><br>
If <strong>gcd(a, m) ≠ 1</strong>, then there does <u>NOT</u> exist a⁻¹.<br><br>
If m is prime, then gcd(a, m) will always equal to 1, for all nonzero 'a' values, and thus every 'a' value will have an inverse in those rings. The inverse of an integer completely depends on the ring, and thus the modulus.

	    <strong><a href="#Rule15"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule15">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 15.</font></strong> Finding the <strong>Multiplicative Inverse</strong> of a has the following formula (as described in Rule of the Ring #7):<br><br>

<strong>a × a⁻¹ ≡ 1 mod m</strong>
<br><br>

Though the multiplicative inverse of a is literally shown as a⁻¹, it is almost never the actual reciprocal of a. The reason for this is simple: All reciprocals other than -1 and 1 are not integers, and are thus not included in the set.<br><br>

Take a = 2, for example. The supposed inverse '1/2' is incorrect, because it is not included in the set. A different inverse must be found specific to the modulus; if the modulus were 3, then an inverse of '2' would work:<br><br>

	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>
	  
	  A simplified form or special case of the Substitution cipher, the <strong>Shift Cipher</strong> (or <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong>) merely shifts every plaintext letter however many so positions rightward in the alphabet, wrapping around when it reaches the end (modular arithmetic!). This is occasionally known as the "ROT" Cipher, and the most well-known example is <a href="https://rot13.com/">ROT13</a>, which shifts rightward precisely halfway through the alphabet.<br><br>

As a generic example, with a key of 1, some shifts would be as follows:<br><br>
a -> b<br>
b -> c<br>
...<br>
z -> a<br><br>
As shown, once the alphabet reaches letter (26 - k) + 1, or the position in the ring <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>26</sub> (26 - k) (since the set begins at 0), the shift returns to the front of the alphabet.<br><br>

It should be obvious to all this is an extremely unsecure cryptosystem, with a keyspace of only 26. It is vulnerable to both letter frequency analysis (explained in Rule 7) and brute-force attacks (Rule 5).

<strong><a href="#Rule17"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule17">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 17.</font></strong> <strong>Vigenère Cipher</strong><br><br>

</em><br><br><br>

<strong>x</strong> = Plaintext message.<br>
<strong>y</strong> = Ciphertext.<br>
<strong>k</strong> = The Key/codeword fed into the encryption and decryption functions, which, like the plaintext, is a series of letters (represented by their numerical value, 0-25) that are used by their i position.<br>
<strong>i</strong> = The position in the string of both the key and the plaintext.<br>
<strong>l</strong> = The length of the codeword.<br>
<strong><strong>ℤ</strong><sub>26</sub></strong> = A ring of the first 26 integers (including 0), matching the 26 characters of the alphabet.<br>
<strong>e<sub>k</sub>(x)</strong> = Encryption function, a mathematical formula that converts x into y.<br>

<strong>mod 26</strong> = The modulus/remainder operator, which represents the usage of modular arithmetic, with all numbers represented by their remainder with respect to 26.

<br><br><br>



<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>

A mere variation of the Shift cipher, in which the shift for each letter is determined by a secret code word 'c', which has 'l' letters. Each character in the code word c represents a number of shifts rightward according to its cipher.<br><br>
The letters of the code word are denoted as (c<sub>0</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, ..., c<sub>l - 1</sub>), and as the keys, they are also represented as (k<sub>0</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, ..., k<sub>l - 1</sub>), respectively.<br><br>

The encryption function works as follows: Each character in the plaintext string 'x' is applied a rightward shift according to it's respective letter (identical position) in the key text (a cyclic shift, if the addition of the key letter produces a number greater than 26).<br><br>

This dictates that the length of the code word must be the same or larger than that of the actual code itself, which is somewhat inefficient for longer plaintexts. E.g., |x| ≤ l.<br><br>

The decryption function, of course, is just the opposite of the encryption function, moving each character of the ciphertext backward by the value in the positional counterpart of the code word 'c'.

<br><br><br>


<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>

The <strong>Affine Cipher</strong> is an attempted improvement of the shift cipher, done by complicating the encryption function through the addition of multiple parameters, but is still extremely easy to break. The affine cipher is performed by splitting the key into two parts:<br><br>

<strong>K = (a, b)</strong><br><br>

The number of possible b values in the system is 26, as it is merely the shift parameter (as shown in the definition equations).<br><br>

The number of possible a values is limited by the condition explicated in Rule 14, with m = 26: only when gcd(a, 26) = 1 is 'a' an inverse, and thus contributive to the number of possible values. Counting all possible values of a (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...), all odd numbers 1-26 other than 13, produces an end result of 12 possible 'a' values.<br><br>

The keyspace, being (#a) × (#b), is therefore 312. This remains very easy to break using a brute-force attack (Rule 5).<br><br> 

Furthermore, letter frequency also remains preserved (since any of a particular character (plaintext) will always be converted to another specific character (ciphertext), despite the minute differences in the encryption function), so a letter frequency analysis attack is also applicable.<br><br>

Though multiple encryption will not increase the security of an affine cipher, it will for other ciphers, such as the Data Encryption Standard (see Rule [[[[).
<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule19"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule19">#</span></a> <font color="red">C. Rule 19.</font></strong> Always, as a rule of life, write denominators as (x)⁻¹ instead of as below a line. With the importance of the inverse operation, it always critical to recognize all divisors as being inverses of their variable. 1/a = a⁻¹.
	  
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule20"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule20">#</span></a> <font color="red">C.

Just know that the encryption function is equal to y and the decryption function is equal to x, and you can simply isolate the appropriate variable to find whichever function you wish.<br><br>
Also recall that the mod operator will simply remain in place - it can be practically ignored until the end of the isolation, with it not playing a part in moving variables from side to side and whatnot.

If the key bit is zero, then the plaintext bit will pass through unchanged, but if the key bit is 1, then the plaintext bit will flip (like binary). Thus, if the keystream (by divine intervention) is straight 0's, then the plaintext will go unencrypted. <br><br>
The central complexity of the Stream Cipher is the generation of the "Key Stream", e.g. the stream of bits with which the plaintext is encrypted. This generation must be performed through <em>Random Numbers</em> - see Rule 23.

<strong>Block Ciphers</strong><br><br>

<strong><u>Mathematical Definition</u></strong>:<br><br>




<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong><br><br>
A cipher that encrypts a block of 'b' plaintext bits all at the same time, where b is not equal to one (since that would be a stream cipher). Thus, the encryption of any plaintext bit in the block depends on the nature of every other plaintext bit in the block, like the positions celestial bodies in a galaxy.<br><br>
Most block ciphers have a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes), such as the AES (see Rule [[[[[), or 64 bits (8 bytes), such as the DES and 3DES (see Rule [[[[[).<br><br>
Block Ciphers are more commonly used than Stream Ciphers in modern computer encryption schemes.
