Until 1976, this was the only form of cryptography in existence, and describes the basic nature of all historical ciphers (such as the shift/caesar cipher and affine cipher) and Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers, and DES & AES. Hash functions are somewhat similar to symmetric algorithms, though they can be considered an independent, <em>third</em> type of Cryptographic algorithm.

	  <strong><a href="#Rule2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule2">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 2.</font></strong> Symmetric Cryptography
	  
	  
	  <br><br>The ancient problem presents itself: How can two parties communicate over an <strong>insecure channel</strong> (an 'open channel') without having their communications be intercepted by a third-party?<br><br>

Say <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> connect through the internet (which is an open channel due to the potential of package rerouting/interception) and transfer data. An opponent, <strong>Oscar</strong>, can read their communications by intercepting the data before it reaches Bob.<br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png"><img src="/cryptography/img/alicebobunsecure.png" alt="A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar." width=90%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing how communications between Alice and Bob, when passing through an insecure channel unencrypted, can be intercepted by the attacker Oscar.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    To stop Oscar from reading the message, an encryption algorithm can be established, converting the plaintext message (x) into a ciphertext message (y), and then sending it through the insecure channel. Oscar would only see a stream of random characters/bits as a result of the encryption. Bob, using a decryption function, would convert the ciphertext back into plaintext, thus completing the data transfer without interception.<br><br>

In order for Bob to not simply decrypt the ciphertext immediately using the decryption function (which should be public for reasons outlined in Rule 3), a <strong>Key</strong> only known to Alice and Bob (sent through a secure, impenetrable channel) must be used as a parameter in both the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>The key must be inputted into the encryption function to influence the manner in which the plaintext is encrypted into cyphertext. Thus, only with the key will Bob be able to decrypt the Ciphertext. Oscar, who doesn't know the key, will be unable to decrypt the message, even if the decryption algorithm is public.<br>
	    <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">  <a href="/cryptography/img/AliceBobSecure.png"><img src="/cryptography/img/AliceBobSecure.png" alt="A diagram showcasing a symmetric cryptosystem, complete with a key sent through a secure channel and encryption/decryption functions." width=90%/></a></div>
	    <span class="tiny"><em>A diagram showcasing a symmetric cryptosystem, complete with a key sent through a secure channel and encryption/decryption functions.</em></span><br><br> 
	    
	    <strong>x</strong> = Plaintext message - the unadulterated, original content of the message.<br><br>

<strong>y</strong> = Ciphertext, which looks like scrambled characters to an interceptor like Oscar.<br><br>

<strong>e</strong> = Encryption function, a mathematical formula that converts x into y.<br><bR>

<strong>d</strong> = Decryption function, a mathematical formula that converts y into x.<br><br>

<strong>K</strong> = The Key fed into the encryption and decryption functions.<br><br>
	    
<strong>|K|, 𝒦</strong> = Keyspace, the total number of possible keys in a cryptosystem. This matters significantly with regard to brute-force Cryptanalysis (see Rule 5). The keyspace corresponds to the <strong>key size</strong> of the algorithm: If it produces a 168-bit key (see Rule [[[[), then there are 2^168 possible keys.
	    
	    
<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#Rule3"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule3">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 3.</font></strong> Keeping the encryption/decryption algorithms 'e' and 'd' secret, preventing their cryptanalysis by the enemy (known as <strong>Security by Obscurity</strong>), was standard procedure for the ~4000 year history of Cryptography prior to the discovery of public-key Cryptography. However, <strong>the only way of ensuring the security of the algorithms is to make them public so it can be analyzed by cryptanalysts</strong>.<br><br>


This is the central principle of a foundational law in Cryptography, postulated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs:<br><br>

<strong>Kerckhoffs' Principle</strong>:<br><br>
<em>"A cryptosystem should be secure even if the attacker</em> (Oscar)<em> knows all the details of the system, with the exception of the secret key."</em><br><br>


In Practice: Never use an untested Crypto algorithm! Furthermore, never roll your own crypto!

<strong><a href="#Rule4"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule4">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 4.</font></strong> There are multitudes of cryptanalysis techniques, and the crucial law is that if just one attack works, then the entire cryptosystem crumbles and fails. While a substitution cipher (Rule 7) may be impenetrable to a brute-force attack (with its 2^88 keyspace), it collapses against letter frequency analysis.<br><br>
In order for a cryptosystem to be considered secure, it must be resistant against every single type of attack. An attacker always looks for the weakest link in the cryptosystem. Thus, in addition to strong algorithms, safeguards against social engineering and implementation attacks must be instituted.<br><br><br>

<strong><a href="#ImplementationAttacksDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="ImplementationAttacksDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Implementation Attacks</font></strong>: Extraction of the key through '<strong>side-channel analysis</strong>'. By observing the behavior of the implementation of the cryptosystem in an IC or software, it is possible to deduce important relation relating to the key.<br><br>
For example: By looking at the electrical power consumption or electromagnetic radiation of a CPU running a cryptographic algorithm, a signal processing technique can be used to recover the key. The run time behavior can also indicate information regarding the key, which is why many cryptographers ensure constant run times in embedded cryptosystems.<br><br>
These attacks are most relevant when the attacker has physical access to a piece of hardware running the cryptosystem, such as a credit card.

The testing of all possible keys in a given keyspace with the decryption function, to see if they produce the plaintext. This is akin to thinking of the cryptosystem as a black box, in which the only significant factor to decoding an encrypted message is the number of possible keys the message could have been created with. 
<br><br>
As of 2010 (very recent), the largest keyspace that can be searched in a relatively reasonable amount of time is 2^60. However, not all key bits are created equally: a 128-bit symmetric key provides roughly the same security as a 3072-bit RSA (asymmetric algorithm) key.<br><br>

	    <span class="tiny"><em>A chart of the time it would take to crack keyspaces of various lengths using a brute-force attack.</em></span><br><br> 

<br> Mathematically, a brute-force search (which respect to the key) is defined as follows:<br><br>
<em>Let (x, y) denote the pair of plaintext and ciphertext, and let K = {k<sub>1</sub> ,..., k<sub>κ</sub> } be the key space of all possible keys k<sub>i</sub>. A brute-force attack now checks for every k<sub>i</sub> ∈ K whether d<sub>k<sub>i</sub></sub> == x.<br><br>

A historical cipher, operating purely on letters, in which every plaintext letter is replaced by a fixed ciphertext letter. It is just scrambling the letters, nothing more.<br><br>

The Keyspace is 26!, or 2^88, as each plaintext letter that maps to a ciphertext letter decreases the remaining number of possible letters. Thus, a brute-force attack would be out of the question for modern computers.<br><br>

Since the different letters of the English alphabet have different frequencies, Letter Frequency Analysis can be conducted as an attack on the substitution cipher, making it rather simple. This is an example of a situation in which an Analytical Attack is most effective.

	  <strong><a href="#Rule8"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule8">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 8.</font></strong> <strong>Modular Arithmetic</strong>:<br><br>

Since the bulk of cryptographic computations are performed in finite sets, special mathematical tools are needed. In particular, Modular Arithmetic is the basis for all modern cryptosystems, and many historical ones as well.<br><br>

Modular arithmetic is a system of simplifying a number in terms of a given <strong>modulus</strong>, the highest number in a set. Any number greater than the modulus is rewritten using the <strong>modulus operator</strong> (or remainder operator, see below), in effect wrapping the number around the modulus in relation to how much greater the number is from the closest (smaller) multiple of the modulus. <br><br>
For example, with a modulus of 12, 61 would be represented as 1 mod 12.<br><br>

The process of finding the modular equivalent of a number is simple: divide the chosen number by the modulus, and find the remainder. The remainder will then be the coefficient in front of the modulus operator. All numbers smaller than the modulus are rendered ordinarily, without the mod operator.<br><br>

Mathematically, modular arithmetic is defined as follows:<br><br><br>
<em>(a, r, m) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><br>
m > 0<br><br>
If <strong>m|(a − r)</strong>, then <strong>a ≡ r mod m</strong>
</em><BR><BR><br>
<strong>ℤ</strong> = The set of all integers.<br>
<strong>a</strong> = The chosen number.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The remainder.<br>

	  To find the remainder when m and a are large, burdensome numbers, there is an exact, algorithmic definition:<br><br><br>

<em>
(a, m) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><br>
0 ≤ r &lt; m <br><br>
a = q × m + r<br>
Thus, a - r = q × m<br><br>
<strong>m|(a − r)</strong>
</em><BR><BR><br>
This is precisely the same as what was discovered before, and q is not in any of the final equations - all that matters is the remainder.<br><Br>

<strong>ℤ</strong> = The set of all integers.<br>
<strong>a</strong> = The chosen number.<br>
<strong>q</strong> = The quotient, which produces a multiple of the modulus.<br>
<strong>r</strong> = The remainder.<br>
<strong>m</strong> = The modulus, the highest possible number in the set.

	  <strong><a href="#Rule10"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule10">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 10.</font></strong> <strong>Equivalence Classes</strong>:<br><br>

While 12 ≡ 3 mod 9, it is equally true that 12 ≡ 21 mod 9, and that 12 ≡ -6 mod 9. This is because, while the remainders may not exactly be the difference between 'a' (12) and the <u>highest</u> multiple of m lesser than a (9), they all still return true in the formula of Rule 8:<br><br>

12 ≡ 3 mod 9, 3 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−3)<br>
12 ≡ 21 mod 9, 21 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−21)<br>
12 ≡ −6 mod 9, −6 is a valid remainder since 9|(12−(−6))<br><br>

The set of all values that behave 'equivalently' for a particular modulus, in that they can be simplified down to the smallest possible positive number for r, form what is known as an <strong>Equivalence Class</strong>, an infinite set/series of values.<br><br>

For 3 mod 9, the equivalence class of r values is an infinite set, a partial series of which is as follows:<br>
{..., -24, -15, -6, 3, 12, 21, 30, ...}<br><br>

If any of these values were to be substituted in for r (3) in 3 mod 9, it would be equivalent, the same value, because of the mod operator.<br><br>

Note: There are 'm' equivalence classes for each possible remainder (0 through m-1), which collectively contain all possible integers. The difference between any two neighboring values in an equivalence class will be the modulus, as shown above.

	  <strong><a href="#Rule11"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule11">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 11.</font></strong> <strong>Modular Reduction</strong>:<br><br>
	  Because any value in an equivalence class acts the same with regard to the mod operator of a given modulus, then substitutions in mathematical operations that use the modulus operator can be performed, simplifying them.<br><br>

Take (13 × 16) - 8, with modulus 5. While the full number can be computed (200) and an answer derived from there (0 mod 5), that is lame and time-consuming. A much cooler, faster, 21st century means of solving the problem is to substitute in for each term the simplest member of their respective equivalence classes:<br><br>

13 mod 5 has a remainder of 3, and so 3 is the simplest term.<br>
16 mod 5 has a remainder of 1, and so 1 is the simplest term.<br>
8 mod 5 has a remainder of 3, and so 3 is the simplest term.<br><br>

Therefore, the same calculation can be performed with simply (3 × 1) - 3, which returns 0 mod 5, the same answer as before, but found much easier-ly.<br><br><br>

Note that this substitution trick does <u>not</u> equally extend to all mathematical operations. Exponentials, for example, cannot be simplified with the modulus:<br><br>
For the problem 3⁸ mod 7, the exponent '8' cannot be simplfied down to 1 mod 7, and the entire problem to 3 mod 7. Exponents simply cannot have the substitution performed.<br><br>
For all exponentials, simplification into smaller components (using the 2nd Holy Property of Exponents, Math Rule 66 ([[[[[)) must be performed to simplify. For ex.: 3⁸ = (3²)⁴ = (9)⁴ = (2)⁴ = 16 mod 7 = <strong>2 mod 7</strong>, which is the answer.<br><br><br>

<strong>Operations where equivalence class substitutions are allowed:</strong><Br><br>
Multiplication<br>

Substraction<br><br>
<strong>Operations where equivalence class substitutions are banned:</strong><br><br>

	    <strong><a href="#IntegerRingDef"><span class="mw-headline" id="IntegerRingDef">#</span></a> <font color="#006400">Integer Ring</font></strong>: A set of elements which can have basic arithmetic operations performed upon them, such as addition and multiplication, so that the natural properties expected of addition and multiplication all hold. There are ring definitions/interpretations of polynomials, matrixes, and modular arithmetic (Rule 13). Rings are a fundamental part of Ring Theory, a field of Abstract algebra. ([[[[[[)

	    <strong>Algebraic Modular Arithmetic</strong>:<br><br>

Modular Arithmetic can be defined in the form of an integer ring:<br><br><br>
<em>
The integer ring <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> consists of the following characteristics:<br><br>
<strong>1.</strong> The set <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> = {0, 1, ..., m-1}<br><br>
<strong>2.</strong> Two arithmetic operators, "+" and "×", hold for all (a, b, c, d) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub> that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>i)</strong>&nbsp; a + b ≡ c mod m<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ii)</strong> a × b ≡ d mod m
</em><br><br><br>

There are many overshadowing rules that every ring has to fulfill, seen in the section "RULES OF THE RING" below.
	    <br><br><br>
	  
	  <div title="You WILL accept these as true. You WON'T try to figure out how they were derived."><strong><font color="blue"><a href="#RingRules"><span class="mw-headline" id="RingRules">#</span></a> RULES OF THE RING:</font></strong></div><br>
  These following rules hold true for all integer rings in general, not just modular arithmetic.<br><br>
  <ol>

<li> The ring should be closed: if any two numbers from the set are multiplied or added together, the result must be in the ring. This is ensured by the modulus operator.</li><br>

<li> Addition and multiplication are associative properties: For all (a, b, c) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.</li><br><br>

<strong>Addition:</strong><br><br><br>

<li> Addition is commutative for all (a, b) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>: a + b = b + a.</li>
<br>

<li>There is an <strong>additive neutral element</strong>, 0. For all elements a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, it holds that <strong>a + 0 ≡ a mod m</strong>.</li>
<br>
<!--ajj- backpack playing in my head all day-->

<li>The <strong>additive inverse</strong> always exists: for any element a in the ring, there is always a negative element '-a' such that <strong>a + (-a) ≡ 0 mod m</strong>, the neutral element.</li>
<br><br>

<strong>Multiplication</strong>:<br><br><br>

<li>There is a <strong>multiplicative neutral element</strong>, 1: For all elements a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, it holds that <strong>a × 1 ≡ a mod m.</strong></li><br>

<li>The <strong>Multiplicative Inverse</strong> exists only for <u>some</u> elements: For a ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong>, the inverse a⁻¹ is defined such that <strong>a × a⁻¹ ≡ 1 mod m</strong>. The nature of most inverses and the reasons for their occasional nonexistence are outlined in Rules 14 & 15.<br><br>
If there exists an inverse for a, then, a rare usage of division in the modular ring becomes possible: the element a⁻¹ can be divided by, as <strong>b/a ≡ b × a⁻¹ mod m</strong>.</li>
<br>


<li> The distributive property holds for all ring operations. For all (a, b, c) ∈ <strong>ℤ</strong><sub>m</sub>, a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).</li>

</ol>

<br><br><br>
	  
	  <strong><a href="#Rule14"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule14">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 14.</font></strong> To determine if an inverse exists for a specific 'a' of a specific modulus, simply find the gcd (Greatest Common Divisor) of the two values:
<br><br>

If gcd(a, m) = 1, then there exists a⁻¹, and a & m are said to be "<strong>relatively prime</strong>", or "<strong>coprime</strong>".<br>
If gcd(a, m) ≠ 1, then there does NOT exist a⁻¹.
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	    <strong><a href="#Rule15"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rule15">#</span></a> <font color="red">P. Rule 15.</font></strong> Finding the <strong>Multiplicative Inverse</strong> of a has the following formula (as described above):<br><br>

<strong>a × a⁻¹ ≡ 1 mod m</strong>
<br><br>

Though the multiplicative inverse of a is literally shown as a⁻¹, it is almost never the actual reciprocal of a. The reason for this is simple: All reciprocals other than -1 and 1 are not integers, and are thus not included in the set.<br><br>

Take a = 2, for example. The supposed inverse '1/2' is incorrect, because it is not included in the set. A different inverse must be found specific to the modulus; if the modulus were 3, then an inverse of '2' would work:<br><br>
<strong>2 × 2 ≡ 1 mod 3</strong>
