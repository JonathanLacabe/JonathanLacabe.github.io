	    <p>Welcome to the <u>Human Knowledge</u> project!<br><br>
	    
	    
	    
	    This website is a curated library of science and mathematics. This website has grown from a mere repository for saving my notes, to a reflection of my ideal of knowledge itself: a liberating force in its power to transcend individual circumstances to form the building blocks of the human rationalization of the Universe.

	      At its core, Human Knowledge is a project that is meant to safekeep knowledge at a time when freedom of information has come under attack. Increasingly, scientific knowledge, and more broadly knowledge as a whole, is being placed behind barriers that prevent universal access, to the profit of private corporations. (For more information, read the <a href ="https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/mode/2up?view=theater">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a>).<br><br> I believe that while knowledge is priceless, it only has value when it is free<!--e.g., piratable-->, when it can be analyzed and expanded upon as a universal construct. It is upon these ideals that I work to make the Human Knowledge project an all-inclusive library of scientific knowledge, providing resources for those new and experienced in such fields as Mathematics, Physics, and Cryptography, and being incorporative of the neglected areas of research and the concepts many consider too 'abstract' for understanding.<br><br> 

I applaud the work of organizations such as OpenCourseWare and Archive.org <!--AND ANNA'S AЯCH1VE/SINGLƎLOGIN--> in furthering the cause of open knowledge. These platforms, along with the great non-profit advocacy companies like Wikimedia and the Electronic Frontier Foundation<!--tor project?-->, have been instrumental in obtaining the information that has comprised this project, and in enabling me to do so.

<br><br>

Apart from availability, accessibility is the greatest equalizer in knowledge; with every concept, I elaborate and describe the concept until I can comfortably understand it, and rest assured, I am no great mind - I must work very hard, learning from examples and testing myself with my own examples, to understand more difficult concepts before I feel I have totally grasped them. <br><br>The notes on this site are only as good as my ability to understand them - it is with this necessity that I strive to make the contents of the website, the "knowledge" as it were, as complete with explanations and intelligible as possible. With the ability to relearn a particular concept through consulting the vast archives of my personal library, I gain access to the greatest teacher I could have, tailored to my exact needs: my past self. To further my ends of accessibility, I have mirrored the project onto both <a href = "https://jonathanlacabe.github.io">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://humanknowledge.neocities.org">Neocities</a>, as frequently I find that one will be blocked by school district censors (such as LAUSD), while the other will remain available.


	    
	      
	      <br><br><br><strong>What Human Knowledge is <u>not</u>:</strong><br><br><BR>
	      While this project is fully supportive of increasing knowledge accessibility, it will not incorporate information from subjects other than the sciences. It is simply a matter of priority: There is an extreme wealth of scientific and mathematical information that is yet to be incorporated into the website, and this is to remain the focus of the website forever.

	  <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><strong>What are the sources for the information present on your site?</strong></h3>
	  There are a variety of sources that I studied from in gaining the information present in the project, from the readings my teacher's gave me in school (and their own videos) to online learning repositories like OpenCourseWare, where I was able to learn directly from M.I.T. and Yale professors (with included practice problems and tests!). <br><br>Of course, I incorporated dozens of one-off sources into my notes as well, in any area that I felt my main source was leaving confusing and incomplete. Out of respect for the privacy of my teachers, I do not link my sources directly, but in every case my goal was to transmute all information present in my sources into my comprehensive and organized note-system, where I can access any knowledge or anything knowledge very quickly, without having to search for it in an hour long lecture. (I found the bulk of my sources by just googling "x lectures" or "fundamentals of x", where I was able to access educational content. This, in my opinion, is what gives the internet its greatest worth).<br><br>
	  Tl;dr, the knowledge present in the Human Knowledge project is a synthesis of multiple sources, not least of all the MIT OpenCourseWare courses, of which I have partaken in (and incorporated the knowledge of into this website) <a href="/information/opencourse.txt">several</a>. ([[[[[)
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  	  <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Why do you study? What is your purpose behind your note-taking?</strong></h3>

	   The Humanities have little interested me, because I've considered them to be very self-indulgent as subjects solely concerning attributes of the human race, which, to me, is much less interesting than the inner workings of the world outside it. An Afghani proverb states, "When you separate the container from the contents, then you will have knowledge." With the Universe and Physics, Physics continues to not be able to explain nor directly observe every phenomenon occurring in a rational Universe. If the Universe is the container and Physics is the contents, how can humanity learn about the container from the inside? The goal of Physics has been to create the laws and theories that can create governance in the Universe, to explain and predict that which occurs. The goal of Physics is to be the container - to completely understand and to produce the laws that control the eternal Universe. <!--the ability of the human mind to correlate all of its contents--><br><br>
 I prefer Physics most strongly over all other subjects, because it focusus the least out of any subject on life on Earth and humanity in particular (except for the more esoteric topics, of course, like the "quantum mind"); Physics focuses entirely on the science that governs the Universe, moreover than any earthly phenomenon that only concerns humans. The study advancement of Physics, I believe, is the greatest affirmation of human existence possible, proof that the human even has the ability to formulate and understand the immensely complex universe (which still remains in question). As the saying goes, "You can't teach a dog Calculus" - it would be another example of human-centric hubris to assume that there is no "dark knowledge"<!--as in dark matter-->, knowledge beyond the limitations of the human brain, that exists, the very imagining of which is beyond human capabilities.
	  
	  
	  <!--some "what have you learned from this project" type question -  homework rules: rules that were created when actually out in the field appliying the base knowledge of the previous, lecture rules, into practice, thus gaining actually useful insight into how problems relating to a concept will generally work. For the student, homework rules will be much more valuable, but for the reviewer before the test, the lecture rules are what you want to look at. -->
	  
	  
	  <!--
	  The purpose of Human Knowledge is to be a constantly expanding, all inclusive library of scientific knowledge that I will forever be able to consult and add to in my scientific studies. Whereas work on paper is limited by space, natural degredation over time, and limits the individual to only being able to study when in the company of their notes, digital note-taking is very freeing, allowing me to
