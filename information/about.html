	  <article>
	    <p>Welcome to the <u>Human Knowledge</u> project!<br><br>
	    
	    
	    
	    This website is a curated library of science and mathematics. This website has grown from a mere data repository to a reflection of my ideal of knowledge itself: a liberating force, in its power to transcend individual circumstances to unite humanity in the common goal of scientific advancement.

	  <p>"Science will only fulfill its promises when the benefits are equally shared by the really poor of the world."<br><br>- <em><strong>César Milstein</strong>, Argentine Nobel Prize winner.</em><center></center><br>
	  
	  <!--<p><center>“If you want to master something, teach it.” - <em>Richard Feynman</em></center><br><br>-->
	  <!--Like you're witnessing something coming into being, expanding and evolving, both grandiose and intimidating, all contained in some random guy's dark basement.-->
	  
	      At its core, the <strong>Human Knowledge Project</strong> is a database meant to safekeep knowledge at a time when free learning resources and freedom of information, <a href="https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/thematic-areas/governance/freedom-of-information/">a fundamental human right</a>, have come under attack.<br><br> <!--The censorship of knowledge, and particular internet censorship, are hallmarks of authoritarian governance and democratic backsliding.-->Sweeping blocks on institutions of learning (see <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/08/09/statement-and-questions-regarding-an-indian-courts-order-to-block-archive-org/">India's block of archive.org</a>, for instance) are detrimental to the free exchange of information necessary for scientific advancement.
	      Furthermore, scientific knowledge has increasingly become placed behind barriers that prevent universal access, to the profit of private corporations. (For more information, read the <a href ="https://archive.org/details/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/mode/2up?view=theater">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a>).<br><br> 
	      
	      I believe that while knowledge is priceless, it only has value when it is free, when it can be analyzed and expanded upon as a universal construct. It is upon these ideals that I work to make the Human Knowledge project an all-inclusive library of scientific knowledge, providing resources for all, from new to experienced, in such fields as Mathematics, Physics, and Cryptography, and being incorporative of the neglected areas of research and the concepts many consider too 'abstract' for understanding.<br><br> 

I applaud the work of organizations such as OpenCourseWare and Archive.org in furthering the cause of open knowledge. These platforms, along with the great non-profit advocacy groups like Wikimedia and the Electronic Frontier Foundation<!--tor project?--> (which have tirelessly defended against the endless stream of challenges these  organizations face), have been instrumental in obtaining the information that has comprised this project, and in enabling me to do so.

<br><br>

Apart from availability, accessibility is the greatest equalizer in knowledge; with every concept, I elaborate and describe the concept until I can comfortably understand it, and rest assured, I am no great mind - I must work very hard, learning from examples and testing myself with my own examples, to understand more difficult concepts before I feel I have totally grasped them. <br><br>The notes on this site are only as good as my ability to understand them - it is with this necessity that I strive to make the contents of the website, the "knowledge" as it were, as complete with explanations and intelligible as possible. With the ability to relearn a particular concept through consulting the vast archives of my personal library, I gain access to the greatest teacher I could have, tailored to my exact needs: my past self. To further my ends of accessibility, I have mirrored the project onto both <a href = "https://jonathanlacabe.github.io">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://humanknowledge.neocities.org">Neocities</a>, as frequently I find that one will be blocked by school district censors (such as LAUSD), while the other will remain available.


	      
	      <br><br><br><strong>What Human Knowledge is <u>not</u>:</strong><br><br>
	      While this project is fully supportive of increasing knowledge accessibility, it will not incorporate information from subjects other than the sciences. It is simply a matter of priority: There is an extreme wealth of scientific and mathematical information that is yet to be incorporated into the website, and this is to remain the focus of the website - forever.

	  </header>
	  <article><br>
	  
	  <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><a href="#Sources">#</a> <strong><span class="mw-headline" id="Sources">What are the sources for the information present on your site?</span></strong></h3>
	  There are a variety of sources that I studied from in gaining the information present in the project, from the readings my teacher's gave me in school (and their own videos) to online learning repositories like OpenCourseWare, where I was able to learn directly from M.I.T. and Yale professors (with included practice problems and tests!). <br><br>
	  
	  Of course, I incorporated dozens of one-off sources into my notes as well, in any area that I felt my main source was leaving confusing and incomplete. Out of respect for the privacy of my teachers, I do not link my sources directly, but in every case my goal was to transmute all information present in my sources into my comprehensive and organized note-system, where I can access any knowledge or anything knowledge very quickly, without having to search for it in an hour long lecture. (I found the bulk of my sources by just googling "x lectures" or "fundamentals of x", where I was able to access educational content. This, in my opinion, is what gives the internet its greatest worth).<br><br>
	  
	  Tl;dr, the knowledge present in the Human Knowledge project is a synthesis of multiple sources, not least of all the MIT OpenCourseWare courses, of which I have partaken in (and incorporated the knowledge of into this website) <a href="/information/opencourse.txt">several</a>.
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><a href="#BeginnerAccessibility">#</a> <strong><span class="mw-headline" id="BeginnerAccessibility">Is the content accessible to beginners?</span></strong></h3>
	  Yes, in a highly original manner.<br><br>
        
        Imagine you are a student taking a college course. The second the lecturer assumes pre-existing knowledge that does not logically follow from what has been taught, or from what was taught in the prerequisite courses, the lecture and the course itself stops being beginner friendly. The course becomes <em>review</em> for those who are already familiar with the subject, and not resource for those learning it for the first time.<br><br>
        
        The Human Knowledge Project must maintain a careful balance - remain loyal to the complexities of the subject being treated, while still maximizing accessibility to the beginner and the easily confused<!-- (e.g., me)-->.<br><br>
        
        What this project does, the real function it performs in service of accessibility, is present knowledge in it's post-confusion form - knowledge that has already been confused over and elaborated upon to a point of total intuitive understanding upon first reading. The labors of translating an inaccessible and rigidly academic learning resource (whether it be a textbook or a lecture series) are presented in exhaustive detail.<br><br>
        
        
        Fundamentally, this project is symbolic of a refusal to be confused in the face of an aggressively un-beginner friendly scientific pedagogy and literature. When an individual accepts confusion regarding a topic and ceases asking questions, they surrender their ability to feel a sense of total comprehension (let alone expertise), and thus abandon the pursuit of knowledge altogether. In this way, educational resources that demotivate and stultify can be as dangerous to the progress of the young scientist as any temptation towards procrastination.<br><br>
        
        An inspirational pedagogy encourages beginners and convinces them of their ability to learn even the most complex of subjects, fostering creativity and the very expansion of knowledge itself through students asking new questions and pushing the envelope. Curiosity!
	  <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  	  <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><a href="#Purpose">#</a> <strong><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose">Why do you study? What is your purpose behind your note-taking?</span></strong></h3>

	   
	   An Afghani proverb states that, "When you separate the container from the contents, then you will have knowledge." With the Universe and Physics, Physics continues to not be able to explain nor directly observe every phenomenon occurring in a rational Universe. If the Universe is the container, and the currently understood laws of Physics are the contents, how can humanity learn about the container from the inside? The goal of Physics has been to create the laws and theories that can establish governance in the Universe, to explain and predict that which occurs. The goal of Physics is to emulate the container - to completely understand and to produce the laws that control the enigmatic Universe.<!--the ability of the human mind to correlate all of its contents--><br><br>
	   
 I prefer Physics most strongly over all other subjects, because it focuses the least out of any subject on life on Earth and humanity in particular<!--(except for more esoteric (and considerably pseudo-scientific) topics, of course, like the "quantum mind" and "quantum immortality")-->; Physics focuses entirely on the science that governs the Universe, moreover than any earthly phenomenon that only concerns humans. The study and advancement of Physics, I believe, is the greatest affirmation of human existence possible, proof that the human even has the ability to formulate and understand the immensely complex universe, which still remains in question. <br><br>
 
 The Humanities have little interested me, because I've considered them to be very self-indulgent as subjects solely concerning attributes of the human race, which, to me, is much less interesting than the inner workings of the world outside it. <br><br>
 
 As the saying goes, "You can't teach a dog Calculus" - it would be another example of human-centric hubris to assume that there is no "dark knowledge"<!--as in dark matter-->, knowledge beyond the limitations of the human brain, that exists, the very imagining of which is beyond human capabilities. This is why I deeply distrust neuroscience as a field capable of producing a conclusory, cohesive explanation of all inner-workings of the human brain: if the brain were simple enough for humans to understand it, then humans would not have the neuro-cognitive abilities to do so.<br><br><br><!--I know it is phrased rather strangely, but you should be able to get the gist of what I said.-->
	  
	  
	  <!--some "what have you learned from this project" type question -  homework rules: rules that were created when actually out in the field applying the base knowledge of the previous, lecture rules, into practice, thus gaining actually useful insight into how problems relating to a concept will generally work. The lecture rules and homework rules fit together like theoretical and experimental - they are both of immense use and value to the student reviewing before a test. -->
	  
	  
	  <!--
	  The purpose of Human Knowledge is to be a constantly expanding, all inclusive library of scientific knowledge that I will forever be able to consult and add to in my scientific studies. Whereas work on paper is limited by space, natural degredation over time, and limits the individual to only being able to study when in the company of their notes, digital note-taking is very freeing, allowing me to

	    How does this website 'accessibilize' knowledge? By removing the burden of having to translate dense overly-academic and verbose scientific knowledge sources (textbooks, lectures, etc.) into knowledge in post-digested form.
	    -->
	    
	     <!-- I want this site to be a reflection of my brain. When I learn something, I want to incorporate it into my mental library by compartmentalizing it into "rules" of thumb that make a subject easier to understand, and when I forget something, I need to be able to fall back on those rules. I can only relearn subjects as much as I can make my notes comprehensible - that is why I keep going back and editing older pages to make them more accessible and easy to understand.

how can this website help others?


Have you created any other websites? And then talk about sternberg.
that will be the "do things you enjoy nonacademically" part of the mit application.



You have the privilege of existing in the most fascinating period of human history, where, unlike the past in which content was routinely lost through natural degrading and the success of ignoramous ideologies that sought to supress knowledge (the book burners), mountains of content have been able to be preserved indefinitely through the internet. Of course, misinformation and losses in content are abound, but

<!-- 
I wish to pursue a future in Cryptography and Physics - to the greatest of my abilities, I have sought to educate and experience myself in these fields with my given resources: self-education via OCW and other university lectures, joining a non-profit focused on distributed AI operating systems (and utilizing post-quantum homomorphic encryption), and creating a personal knowledge base (the Human Knowledge Project) to store all of my work.

	    <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><a href="#WritingStyle">#</a> <strong><span class="mw-headline" id="WritingStyle">What is your writing style philosophy?</span></strong></h3>
	  The knowledge presented is not faithful to singular sources - with every confusion, there comes research and the discovery/incorporation of knowledge from additional sources <!--knowledge adultery--> until a level of comfortable understanding is reached.<br><Br>
        
        As such, the Rules of the project, admittedly, read a little bit like lecture notes that could be read out in front of a class. They are not written in rigidly academic language, adding to their accessibility. <br><br>
        
        This partly derives from my experience in founding/leading a Coding Club at my high school, as well as leading afterschool tutoring sessions for Java and other programming languages. I had to structure and create my presentations so that they could be understood by students who had little-to-no experience in the topic being discussed. <br><br>
        
        Furthermore, with the student I'm writing for in the Human Knowledge Project being, in effect, my future self (who, due to the forgetting curve, will have forgotten everything), the perspective and mindset I have for the structure of the content itself is to facilitate the reteaching of my future self of the topic.

	    <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><a href="#Dread">#</a> <strong><span class="mw-headline" id="Dread">What is "Achievement Dread"?</span></strong></h3>

	   
	   <!--There is one final issue, a facet of my character and philosophy I feel must be expressed clearly at the end of long series of essays.-->
Achievement Dread is a central tenet of my philosophy and of the personal value I assign to this project. It would not be untrue to say that other than the absolute excitement that motivates my studying and work, that there is also an internal sense of dread driving me forward.<br><br>

I call it "<strong>Achievement Dread</strong>", and I would find it unlikely that this sense is not held by <!--incoming students at MITES, MIT itself,--> ambitious students and anyone whose future remains in the balance, who is yet to "make something" of themselves and feel the resulting pressure. <br><br>

For many, this pressure could be from high expectations from their families or teachers - for me, it is an internal monologue of infinite chastisement, an obsession holding myself accountable for all my inactions.<br><br>

This dread, with its unfailing sense of how time is being spent, compounds into panic and anxiety with the slightest provocation. It promises my salvation as a great scientist, but replaces enthusiasm with fear. It is the war between "create something to be proud of", and "Publish or perish".<br><br>

<!--I was relieved to discover that the atmosphere of MIT, beyond the welcoming nature of MITES, is less choking in pressuring students to fall into this, and encourages innovation through passionate, guided exploration, though I'm yet to confirm this in person.-->


While dread has a minor workaholic benefit, it dehumanizes you, pushes you to become a drone, a work machine, and worst, it makes you do what you think you're supposed to do rather than what you actually want to do, nullifying and betraying the original passion.<br><br>

All visionaries and revolutionaries are driven by passion over dread and fear. No revolution, scientific or otherwise, occurs without that sense of enthusiastic fanaticism, of commitment to an ideal and higher purpose - for me, that of expanding educational opportunity and filling the gaps in humanity's explanation of the universe.<br><br>


This dread, while seemingly acting in my best interests, is only a primal response to my anxiety over my future. Passion must be one's driving force, because love is always a greater teacher than a sense of duty.<br><br>
 
 The bottom of every page on this project bears and reaffirms the purpose that compels me to build this website, and, accordingly, my knowledge, for as long as I learn - made with love.
