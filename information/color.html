	  <article>
	    <p>At the very beginning of high school, I developed my own color-coded system of note-taking, using the three colored pens that were available to me at the time: <font color="red">Red</font> for the core notes ('Rules' of thumb and explanations), <font color="blue">Blue</font> for Other Important Information™, and <font color="#006400">Green</font> for definitions. These were the notes that would form the basis for this website. Full explanations can be read below.<br></p>

	    <h2><a href="#Rules">#</a> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rules"><font color="red">Rules</font></span></h2>
	  </header>
	  <article><br>
	      All numbered notes (which I call <u>Rules</u>) are red, and include examples and the basis for understanding a topic. The Rule numberings are sequential within each parent category: For example, Algebra II ends with Rule 77, while Precalculus begins with Rule 78, continuing through Single-Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus and all of mathematics.<br><br>
	      Each Parent Category has a designated prefix abbreviation for the Rule Numberings: Physics has rules prefixed with "P. Rule", while Astronomy has "A. Rule". Mathematics, being the original Rules created under my system, has no such abbreviation.

	  </header>
	  <article><br>
	  "<u>Other Important Information</u>™", such as large-scale drawings that are better visualized than explained, were written in blue. Examples of what this entails can be seen <a href="/math/precalculus/pci#CommonFuncParents">here</a> and <a href="/math/algebraII/quadtranslation#QuadDissection">here</a>.<br><br>
	  I use ascii line drawings sparingly - If I can convey information or a graph using an image online, I will do so.

	  <article><br>
	  Definitions are written in green. Much of the time, definitions for a concept will be placed directly prior to the Rules and Other Imp. explanations for it, so that the terms used in those explanations can be referred to without any confusion.

	    <h2><a href="#WoO">#</a> <span class="mw-headline" id="WoO"><font color="purple">WoO: Unnumbered Rules</font></span></h2>
	  </header>
	  <article><br>
      Notes that begin with "<strong><font color="purple">X. WoO</font></strong>" instead of the regular rule format are indeed rules, just those created after the fact.<br><br>
	    
	    In my work to make this website an all-inclusive library of knowledge, I have added this unique note-type for new additions to old sections. Since adding new rules would require moving all following rules up a number (an extremely tedious process), I have created WoO Rules, which are denoted only by their placement in relation to the Rules, Other Imp.'s, and Definitions around them. <a href="/math/precalculus/pci#WoO_105_1">Example</a>.
	    
	    
	    <br><br>WoO is the only note-type that does not appear in my paper notes, as it is intended to be supplementary to the core material included in said notes. The WoO notes were much of the time created long after I originally took the course the notes pertain to, and thus have a more reflective view of the material than that of an individual who is learning it for the first time.<br><br>
	    Whether WoO notes are of a "higher quality" than the other notes is up for debate. Either way, I intend to undergo full studies of my existing notes as time goes on to make elaborations and general improvements, making the Human Knowledge project into a more accurate and fully-fledged curated library of scientific and mathematical knowledge, and thus, inevitably, creating more WoO rules.<br><br>
	    The name "WoO" is in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoO">compositional cataloging system</a> used for composers like Beethoven and Brahms, literally meaning "Without Opus Number" in German.
