	    <h2>Color Coding System.</h2>

	  <article>
	    <p>At the beginning of high school, I developed my own color-coding system of note-taking, using the three colored pens that were available to me at the time: <font color="red">Red</font> for the core notes ('Rules' of thumb and explanations), <font color="blue">Blue</font> for Other Important Information™, and <font color="#006400">Green</font> for definitions. These note-types form the basic structure for the content of this project. Full explanations can be read below.<br></p>

	    <h2><a href="#Rules">#</a> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rules"><font color="red">Rules</font></span></h2>
	  </header>
	  <article><br>
	      All numbered notes (which I call <u>Rules</u>) are red, and cover the core concept and basis for understanding a topic. To make the concept more approachable and understandable, Rules tend to include examples, analogies, and metaphors. The Rule numberings are sequential within each parent category: For example, Algebra II ends with Rule 77, while Precalculus begins with Rule 78, continuing through Single-Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus and all of mathematics.<br><br>
	      
	      Each Parent Category has a designated prefix abbreviation for the Rule Numberings: Physics has rules prefixed with "P. Rule", Astronomy has "A. Rule", and Cryptography has "C. Rule". Mathematics, being the original Rules created under my system, has no such abbreviation. In other subjects, math Rules are simply referred to as "math Rule x".

	    <h2><a href="#OtherImp">#</a> <span class="mw-headline" id="OtherImp"><font color="blue">Other Important Information</font></span></h2>
	  </header>
	  <article><br>
	  Blue sections hold "<u>Other Important Information</u>™", such as large-scale drawings that are better visualized than explained. Examples of what content these sections may entail can be seen <a href="/math/precalculus/pci#CommonFuncParents">here</a> and <a href="/math/algebraII/quadtranslation#QuadDissection">here</a>.<br><br>
	  
	  Blue sections are more of an art than a science, with some content just not quite befitting a Rule, nor of a definition, such as <a href="/Physics/electromagnetism/ElectricPotential#ElectricPotentialIntro">introductions</a> and <a href="/Physics/mechanics/velspaccel#UAMMemory">memorization tools</a>. Occasionally, I will use blue sections to emphasize a particular point I want to make, such as in <a href="/Physics/electromagnetism/Circuitry#CapacitorSection">meta discussions of how a concept will be taught</a>.<!--yet more evidence as to how textbook writing and work on this project is basically composition. When I am in the zone, creating an example or a metaphor or whatever, I can feel the creative spirit--><br><br>
	  
	  I use ascii line drawings sparingly - If I can convey information or a graph using an image online, I will do so and will give attribution to the original source.

	  <article><br>
	  Definitions are written in green. Much of the time, definitions for a concept will be placed directly prior to the Rules and Other Imp. explanations for it, so that the terms used in those explanations can be referred to without any confusion.

	    <h2><a href="#WoO">#</a> <span class="mw-headline" id="WoO"><font color="purple">WoO: Unnumbered Rules</font></span></h2>
	  </header>
	  <article><br>
      Notes that begin with <strong><font color="purple">WoO "X". Y: [descriptor].</font></strong> instead of the regular rule format are indeed rules, just those created after the fact, thus unnumbered.<br><br>
	    
	    In my work to make this website an all-inclusive library of knowledge, I have added this unique note-type for new additions to old sections. Since adding new rules would require moving all following rules up a number (an extremely tedious process), I have created WoO Rules, which are denoted only by their placement in relation to the Rules, Other Imp.'s, and Definitions before them (representing 'X' in the given formula). <a href="/math/precalculus/pci#WoO_105_1">Example</a>.<br><br>
	    
	    <!--Here is a description under the old way of doing things, which had a high emphasize on the fact that the site had the fundamental intention of compiling my notes instead of compiling all of human knowledge:
	    WoO is the only note-type that does not appear in my paper notes, as it is intended to be a <em>digital supplement</em> to the core material included in said notes. The WoO notes are, much of the time, created long after I originally took the course the notes pertain to, and thus have a more reflective view of the material than that of an individual who is learning it for the first time.<br><br>
	    -->
	    
	    In order to make this website more encyclopedic, accessible, and organized, all WoO notes will eventually become fully-fledged rules, or other types of notes, upon my ability to undergo a full-scale revisal of a particular section. I have previously undergone several Physics section revisals in which I created and removed several Rules, in doing so updating the Rule numberings. As such, WoO notes are inherently temporary.<br><br>
	    
	    Either way, I intend to undergo full studies of my existing notes over time to make elaborations and general improvements, making the Human Knowledge project into a more accurate and fully-fledged curated library of scientific and mathematical knowledge. This would, inevitably, lead to both the removal (as I put the section under revisal) and creation (as I add more material to a section not under revisal) of more WoO rules.<br><br>
	    
	    The name "WoO" is in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoO">compositional cataloging system</a> used for composers like Beethoven and Brahms, literally meaning "Without Opus Number" in German.
