November 23 2024: Began forming what would become the About, FAQ, Color Coding, and Recent Changes pages. This all spawned from my need to create a page explaining the new WoO system, which reawoke my desire to create an FAQ page, and from there the ideas began forming. The individual pages were created, but they were not completed in any form.

July 31 - November 22 2024:  I hadn't created this page yet. Most of the work performed on the site during this period is saved in the various commits made to the Github mirror, where the differences between each revision made to the site can be seen: https://github.com/JonathanLacabe/JonathanLacabe.github.io/commits/main/?since=2024-08-27&until=2024-11-22
