CHANGE LOG

All changes to any page on the Human Knowledge project will described here. For a complete difference comparison of the exact changes made on a particular day, find that date on the commits page of the Github mirror: https://github.com/JonathanLacabe/JonathanLacabe.github.io/commits/main/




December 13 2024: Work both on Physics and Calculus.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 142, 
Rules Added: Mathematics, Single Variable Calculus - Rule 119, 120, 121, 122.

December 12 2024: Topic Refocusing - goal will shift from Astronomy to Calculus and Physics from now on. Over the next few weeks, I plan to go very extensive with my Physics coverage, as well as (hopefully) Cryptography and possibly some Electrical Engineering. There are only so many hours in the day, but 23 days is a long time. Today, work was performed on Calculus.
Rules Added: Mathematics, Single Variable Calculus - Rule 116, 117, 118. 

December 11 2024: Finished with astronomy temporaria, and removed it.

December 10 2024: Began adding ~temporaria~ astronomy material that will be removed shortly. I am currently processing a large amount of data, and it will be removed after I finish. 

December 9 2024: More work on Astronomy - this is my plan until Wednesday. A small amount of work was also done in Calculus as well.
Rules Added: Astronomy, Classical Astronomy - Rule 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
Rules Added: Mathematics, Single Variable Calculus - Rule 113, 114, 115.

December 8 2024: Astronomy-focused day. Everything in Astronomy was updated, fixing all sorts of inconsistencies, types, irregularities, and beyond. I can now comprehend it much better, which is most important.

December 6 2024: Further work on Calculus. Additionally, every page on the website was updated to incorporate the new Art page, which should be the last major site-wide update until the summer plan (or until I think of something else). The Sitemap was also updated for the first time in a while.
Rules Added: Mathematics, Single Variable Calculus - Rule 109, 110, 111, 112.

December 5 2024: Work on the Calculus page, largely.
Rules Added: Mathematics, Single Variable Calculus - Rule 106, 107, 108.

December 4 2024: Some additions to the Math Symbols page.

December 3 2024: Work on Calculus has begun; the rest of Precalculus must be done slowly over time, similar to the math symbols page, as I will have to do my own research into the subject after the fact in order to fill in the missing content (since I wrote almost no Rules for the subject when I took it). Furthermore, I obtained permission from Mr. Kim to add him to the Special Thanks page. I began experimenting with a new information page, which may entail another updating of every page...
Rules Added: Astronomy, Classical Astronomy - Rule 33.

December 2 2024: Several revisions were made to the About page, including the addition of Mr. Cooper after I was given permission to add him.

December 1 2024: Made some minor revisions and additions in order to remove missing references ('[' symbols) from Rule 68. Furthermore, I fixed an issue that was causing mathJax (used extensively in the Physics pages) to not load correctly on the GitHub mirror. All Physics pages were changed to reflect this fix, as well as some math pages.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 141.

November 30 2024: Changes, fixes, and elaborations to Classical Mechanics IX.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - None, just lots of revisions.

November 29 2024: Finished torque, and some Quality of life changes to make myself easier to understand. Created the page for Gravitation and linked it everywhere.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 137, 138, 139, 140.

November 28 2024: Total efforts toward torque.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136.

November 27 2024: Edited the About page further, adding "Flipping Physics" to the Special Thanks register and trimming one of the answers in the FAQ. Much work was done today in Rotational Dynamics of Classical Mechanics, particularly in the Torque section.
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 125, 126, 127, 128, 129.

November 26 2024: Made several changes/corrections to various rules in Physics, Classical Mechanics, particularly in Rotational Motion. Added Disclaimer to the Special Thanks section of the About page, alongside other edits. 
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 55 (finished the Rotational Motion section), 124.

November 25 2024: Made several changes/corrections to various rules in Physics, Classical Mechanics. 
Rules Added: Physics, Classical Mechanics - Rule 53, 54.

November 24 2024: Finished these internal pages: Color Coding. About (for the most part - it is now in a 'working' version available to the public).
Furthermore, I changed the front page logo from one that said "J. Lacabe" to one that says "Human Knowledge", since this is not my personal blog. I left the original "J. Lacabe" image on the About page, for perpetuity. Additionally, every page on the site received an edit to account for the new internal pages, including sidebar additions and changed beginning paragraphs for the pages that reference color coding for the notes.

November 23 2024: Began forming what would become the About, FAQ, Color Coding, and Recent Changes pages. This all spawned from my need to create a page explaining the new WoO system, which reawoke my desire to create an FAQ page, and from there the ideas began forming. The individual pages were created, but they were not completed in any form.

July 31 - November 22 2024:  I hadn't created this page yet. Most of the work performed on the site during this period is saved in the various commits made to the Github mirror, where the differences between each revision made to the site can be seen: https://github.com/JonathanLacabe/JonathanLacabe.github.io/commits/main/?since=2024-08-27&until=2024-11-22
