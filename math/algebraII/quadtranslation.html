	  <article>
	    <p>These are my complete notes for Quadratic Translation in Algebra II. <br><br>I color-coded my notes according to their meaning - All numbered notes (which I call rules) are red, and include examples and the basis for understanding a topic. Definitions are written in green, and other important information (such as large-scale drawings that are better visualized than explained) was written in blue. All of this information is preserved on this page, with logical flow and breaks. I use ascii line drawings sparingly - If I can convey information or a graph using an image online, I will do so.<br><br>All of the knowledge present in these notes are filtered through my personal explanations for them, the result of my attempts to understand and study them from my classes. In the unlikely event there are any egregious errors, contact me at <a href="mailto:jdlacabe@gmail.com">jdlacabe@gmail.com</a>.</p>

	    <br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 1.</font></strong> Quantity, the value in the parentheses of a quadratic equation, changes the horizontal location in the opposite manner to what is expected: y = (x-4)² will translate the parabola 4 spaces to the right rather than to the left. The y-axis change comes after the parenthesis, and is done as you would expect: a -6 moves the parabola down six spaces, while +2 brings it up two. See fig. 1. for proof of these traits of the quadratic translation.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 2.</font></strong> None of the truths of Rule 1. change when the equation becomes negative, y = -(x - 4)² + 2 is just the positive parabola upside down.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 3.</font></strong> For -(x - 4)², the square only applies for inside the quantity, the outer neative sticks around until the end when distribution comes (opposite/reverse everything, see Rule 1).<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 4.</font></strong> The parent function (most simplified version) of all quadratic equations is f(x) = x², given the equation has an exponent no higher than 2. Transformation means to move the function along the graphical plane in some way, such as translation vertically or horizontally (as described in Rule 1).<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 5.</font></strong> The all powerful formula: <strong> g(x) = a(x - h)² + k</strong>. This formula is known is <strong>Vertex Form</strong>. a is the coefficient, the number in front of x to be distributed after simplifying. h is the horizontal shift (opposite, R. 1). k is the vertical shift (normal, R. 1). <br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Axis of Symmetry</font></strong>: The vertical line that will divide the parabola into two equal parts. h is this axis, generally.<br><br><br>
	   
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 6.</font></strong> In all forms, a decides whether the function/parabola will be positive or negative. h is the axis of symmetry and plugging in 0 for x provides the y-intercept.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 7.</font></strong> The <strong>Standard Form</strong> equation is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Converting to Vertex Form (Rules 5 & 6) is h = -b / 2a, and k = f(-b / 2a), plugging in h for x.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <font color="blue"><strong>Comparison of Standard and Vertex Form:</strong></font><br><br>
	    Standard Form = f(x) = ax² + bx + c<br>
	    Vertex Form = f(x) = a(x - h)² + k<br><br>
	    Vertex a is Standard a<br>
	    Vertex h is Standard (-b / 2a)<br>
	    Vertex k is Standard f(plug h for x)<br>
	    
	    <!-- ┗ ┛ ┏ ┓ ┳  ┃ ━  ┳ ┻ ┣ ┫  ╋  ← → ↑ ↓ ↖ ↗ ↘ ↙   &lt; is <, &gt; is >, &amp; is &-->
	    <!-- alt-0178 for superscript 2, 0179 for 3. Others are further up.-->
	    <br><br>
	    
	    
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 8.</font></strong> When you are dividing zero by a number, the answer will always be zero.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 9.</font></strong> For Axis of Symmetry, always state if as x = #, not just what the # is. Remember for tests. Vertical line.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Minimum Value</font></strong>: The Vertex/Domain for X when the function is at its lowest point.<br><br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Maximum Value</font></strong>: The Vertex/Domain for X when the function is at its highest point.<br><br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Domain</font></strong>: The value where x exists in which X has its limits set, all real numbers within it, see above.<br><br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Range</font></strong>: The limits of Y, where it exists give the Min/Max value.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 10.</font></strong> Domain is the value of x in certain imposed or natural limits, such as Max/Min values, with certain applied factors, like Decreasing or Increasing. From a vertical perspective, going up (a positive slope) is Increasing, while going down is decreasing.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 11.</font></strong> Decreasing Domains for wave parabolas have > greater than symbols, [ 2 > x, x > -2  ]. Increasing domains use lesser than symbols, [ -3 &lt; x, x &lt; 4  ], Range is below. For normal y = x² parabolas, Domain = all real #s.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 12.</font></strong> Range is the domain for Y (Domain, Range). While for parabolas X generally doesn't have a Min/Max value, Y has a Range based on the vertex. Y uses >= of &lt;=, as it is equal and infinitely going past the Min/Max value. For a vertex of (2, -3) with a pos. a, the range is y >= 3, a parabola that just stoops below and to the right of the graph for its vertex.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 13.</font></strong> For <strong>Intercept Form</strong> f(x) = a(x - p)(x - q), converting to Vertex Form is h = (p + q) / 2, and k is plugging in h for x, just like Rule 7. See rules 5, 6 and 16.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 14.</font></strong> Two equations use negatives, complicating matters as you have to reverse the variable based on the positive or negative nature of the # of the particular equation. For Vertex Form, reverse h from the specific equation. In Standard Form, no reversing is necessary, the equation is positive. For Intercept Form, both p and q must be reversed.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 15.</font></strong> In equations like -x² where you have to plug in for x, the proper way to apply the number would be -(2)², applying the square first and then the negative afterwards, in the order of operations.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 16.</font></strong> Intercept form allows you to see the x-intercepts of the equation by simply reversing p & q. This is why it is Intercept form. See Rule 13.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 17.</font></strong> For an x-intercept of (0, 0) in Intercept form, there is a particular way to phrase it. Instead of writing g(x) = 1(x + 6)(x + 0), you cut out q from the equation (considering zero is not relevant), and place it at the front, always meaning q = 0, like so: -x(x + 6). a = -1, p = 6, q = 0. There should be no squares in the equation, see below.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 18.</font></strong> Intercept Form is the only Parabola Form that contains no squares (rule 4). However, when there is only x-intercept, it is possible to desimplify by taking the doubled quantities of -2(x - 3)(x - 3) and squaring it to make y = -2(x - 3). This may be confused for a Vertex Form equation with a k of 0, so always half-simplify to see. You will get the same answer either way.<br><br><br>
	   
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Pass-through Point</font></strong>: The point in which a particular parabola equation h is used for substitution.<br>
	    <strong><font color="#006400">Prime Factor</font></strong>: A trinomial or other equation that can't be factored.<br><br><br>
	    
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 19.</font></strong> Finding the equation of a parabola from just a point it passes through and a form-specific Indentifer is possible through substitution. Simply to get a. <br>
	      a. For Vertex Form, create the equation from the known vertex to get the base equation and substitute in the known pass-through point to get a. Ex: You have the base equation of y = a(x + 5)² + 9 and the PTP is (-7, -15). You'd plug in -15 for y and -7 for x, getting the equation -15 = a(-7 + 5)² + 9. Simplify, and you'll find a = 6 and y = -6(x + 5)² + 9.<br>
	      b. For Intercept Form, mostly the same thing as Vertex Form; find the base equation through the given x-intercepts and simplify using the given PTP. Ex: Base equation is y = a(x - 9)(x - 1). Plug in PTP of (0, -18), get -18 = a(0 - 9)(0 - 1). Simplifying proves a = -2.<br>
	      c. Convert Standard Form to vertex and do it. Nothing special.
	    <br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 20.</font></strong> f(x) just means y, written in function form. So is g(x). They are all the same.<br><br><br>
	    <strong><font color="red">Rule 21.</font></strong> The Square root, √, is also known as a radical. <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">27</span></span> = Radical Twenty Seven. For the regular square root, it takes two to get out of the square using the 28|2 method, 2<span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">7</span></span>. For cube roots, it takes three to get out, turning 3√<span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">3</span></span> for 27 into just 3. For fractions like <span style="white-space: nowrap">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">16 / 25</span></span>, all you have to do is square root the numerator and the denominator, getting a result of 4/5. You have to apply the method to the numerator and the denominator.<br><br>
