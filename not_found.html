    <p style="font-size:162%;">...yet! This project is constantly expanding, so if a resource is not found right now, it may very well be discovered in the future!<br><br>
    Like you, this website is constantly learning and incorporating new information to become better and more complete.<br><br>
    
    The mission of this project is one that has no end-date, nor any definitive mark of completion (atleast until U.F.T.) - I will keep working on this forever, for as long as I can learn or am capable of doing so.<br><br>Pursue your ambitions without inhibitions. Like the first time you've ever done it, and the last time you ever will.</p>
